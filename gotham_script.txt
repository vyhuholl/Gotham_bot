                


                    			Oh! Hey.
 What? I think she got my wallet.
 Yeah.
 Hey! Thief, stop! Stop her! Pss-pss.
 Oh, come on, Tom, it wasn't that bad.
 Oh, no? Childish drivel.
 Well, the acting was fine and the music was lovely.
 What about you, Bruce? Sorry, Morn, I agree with Dad.
 It was kind of lame.
 There's no such word as kind of.
 - It was totally lame.
 - You two are so judgmental.
 - What's up, folks? - Stay calm, Bruce.
 Give me your money.
 No problem.
 We're cooperating.
 The necklace.
 It's okay.
 Easy.
 Mom? Mom? Dad? Dad! Dad.
 No! Sit down.
 - Don't move.
 - Don't touch my face.
 - Ease up! - Shut up.
 I need my pills.
 - I need my pills.
 - You wish.
 Come on, where are my pills? Back, back.
 Come on.
 Where are my pills? - Give me my pills, bitch.
 - Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I got this! Hold your fire.
 Easy, easy.
 Sir, look at me.
 Not at them, look at me.
 My name's Jim, Jim Gordon.
 What's yours? I need my pills.
 Everything's gonna be all right.
 Look at me.
 I got your pills right here.
 Huh? You want some pills? Want some pills? All right.
 Here you go, here you go.
 Here are some pills for you, all right? These aren't my pills.
 Sorry, guys, didn't mean to bark at you like that.
 - I got a little bit carried away.
 - Get up here.
 Hey, come on.
 Take it easy.
 - Come on, hey, guys.
 - Hey.
 What the hell are you doing? - We had the drop on him.
 - Well, he's dropped, isn't he? You could have gotten hurt.
 Rookie mistake.
 Next time, shoot the son-of-a-bitch.
 If I shoot, that sets everybody off.
 Gunfire every which way.
 Somebody takes a cop's gun, you shoot him.
 - That's basic.
 - Bullock, Gordon, you're up.
 Double homicide, Theater District.
 Give me a break.
 Shift's nearly over.
 Yeah, nearly.
 Oh, the legendary Harvey Bullock.
 No rest for the wicked, eh? Tannenbaum, looking crisp.
 This is my new partner, James Gordon.
 What we got? Just got here myself.
 Male, female, gunshot.
 Their kid saw the whole thing.
 Poor bastard hasn't spoke a word yet.
 My name's James Gordon.
 I'm a detective.
 What's your name? It's okay.
 You don't have to talk.
 Listen, T, do me a favor.
 You didn't see me, okay? I see you right in front of me.
 What's your problem? That's Thomas and Martha Wayne.
 I don't need that hassle.
 Call Major Crimes, they'd love to have this.
 Yeah, but they're not here.
 And your partner's talking to the witness.
 So that makes it your case.
 Bruce.
 My name is Bruce Wayne.
 Can you tell me what happened, Bruce? When I was about your age, a drunk driver hit our car.
 Killed my dad.
 I was right next to him.
 I know how you feel right now.
 And I promise you, however dark and scary the world might be right now there will be light.
 There will be light, Bruce.
 We just got out of the movies.
 We were walking through the alley to catch an uptown cab and a man came out of the shadows.
 He was tall with a black mask.
 He had a hat and gloves and shiny shoes.
 He took my dad's wallet and my mom's necklace.
 And then he shot them for no reason.
 I should have done something.
 But I was too scared.
 There was nothing you could have done to stop what happened.
 But there is something you can do now.
 You can be strong.
 Be strong.
 I promise you, I will find the man who did this.
 Hey, who the hell is that? James Gordon.
 Alfred Pennyworth.
 We're gonna get the guy that did this, sir.
 New boy, are you? You could say.
 Good luck, mate.
 Come.
 Don't look, head up, eyes front.
 Don't let them see you cry.
 Shouldn't we be there when they move the victims? Why? Listen, hotshot, do me a favor.
 Don't start talking to witnesses until I say so.
 - What's your problem? - My problem, soldier boy you just caught us a gigantic flaming ball of crap.
 Oh, yeah? How's that? You never heard of Thomas and Martha Wayne? Yeah, sure.
 The Wayne Foundation.
 Yeah, two of the richest and most powerful people in Gotham.
 You can't even imagine the pressure if we don't close this quick.
 - So let's close it quick.
 - Yeah, right.
 This is a random street robbery, Holmes.
 Perp could be any one of 10,000 mopes out there.
 Oh, crap.
 Order up.
 Well, well, well, if it isn't Montoya and Allen.
 Major Crimes Unit.
 - This is my new partner, Jim Gordon.
 - Nice to meet you.
 - Hi, Harvey.
 - You're on the Waynes, huh? - It's a terrible thing.
 - Yeah.
 - Any leads? - Just getting started.
 I'll be straight.
 You want us to take it off your hands? - No, no, no.
 - Hold on, rook.
 Why you want it? You got a lead? No, we just need the press action.
 I don't know.
 Come on.
 You know you're scared of this case.
 - I'm scared.
 - So do the right thing for once.
 For once? Where the hell do you get the nerve to say that to me? - You can kiss my ass.
 - Okay, you be that way, brother.
 We're just trying to be collegial.
 You know, I almost gave it to you.
 But you couldn't help yourselves.
 You had to go and be disrespectful.
 Okay, Harvey.
 Stay frosty.
 Good luck.
 Self-righteous do-gooding skell huggers.
 Always badmouthing us like they're such freaking angels.
 Please.
 As mayor of this great city I swear to you, the perpetrators of this heinous crime will be captured and will be punished to the fullest extent.
 I swear that to you.
 Poor bastard.
 First a crime wave, and now this.
 Take all the people and resources you need.
 Just close this case.
 Yes, captain.
 Jim, will you give us a minute? Captain.
 The answer is no.
 - Teach him the ropes.
 - On a weak case? - Yes.
 - Do you want me to change his diapers? He'll get me killed.
 I don't care, I can't go out there with him.
 She said you had to keep me, huh? Yeah.
 She did.
 She said you're a war hero.
 And your daddy was a big-shot DA back in the olden days.
 So I have to keep my trap shut and do as I'm told.
 Ouch.
 Listen, kid.
 You got juice, do me a favor, ask for a transfer.
 Yeah, no.
 Sorry, this is where the action is.
 You'll get used to me.
 Jim, you seem like a nice guy.
 But this is not a city or a job for nice guys.
 You understand? - No.
 - And that's your problem.
 You're a cynic.
 A slovenly, lackadaisical cynic.
 You're probably right.
 Okay, soldier boy let's go roust some muggers.
 Lackadaisical.
 Hmm.
 Hey.
 How you doing? Guess what this is.
 Just tell me, Ed.
 I want riddles, I'll read the funny pages.
 It's a .
45 caliber Came out of Thomas Wayne's chest.
 - That's a six dollar bullet.
 - Uh-huh.
 - What kind of gun--? - Ah-ah-ah.
 Don't ask, just tell.
 It's from a pistol not known by our database.
 No prints either.
 What else you got? What's nowhere but everywhere except where something is? Nothing? You need professional help, Nygma.
 Seriously.
 Let's go.
 So I'm thinking, our man wears shiny shoes uses high-end ammo, and nobody on the street knows who he is? Maybe he's not from the street.
 Like, a debonair playboy robber does it for kicks? Who would pretend to be a street robber, huh? A professional killer, or somebody with a personal grudge against the Waynes.
 How'd this professional know the Waynes would come down that alley? Good question.
 Essen said we don't catch a break in the first 48, go see Fish Mooney.
 - Fish Mooney? Works for Carmine Falcone? - Her.
 Theater district's her turf.
 Anything happens there, she hears about it.
 Why didn't we come to her first? She's kind of a last resort.
 Tell Fish I'm here.
 Hmm.
 - Unh! - I still care for you deeply.
 But I don't believe that you care for me anymore.
 I care for you.
 Then where's my money? I'll get it, I'll get it.
 Boy.
 - Sorry.
 - If you let this hair go frizzy, you will be.
 Ma'am, Detective Bullock is here.
 - Keep him warm.
 - Yes, ma'am Hey, Oswald, you want a turn? - May I? - Knock yourself out, kid.
 Thank you, Mr.
 Gilzean.
 - Harvey.
 Ha, ha.
 - Fish.
 Where have you been? Where haven't I been? - Who's the friend? - Detective James Gordon, ma'am.
 Hmm.
 Well, aren't you a cool glass of milk.
 Ma'am, was that screaming we heard back there? Yes.
 My boys are watching a scary movie.
 - Really.
 - No.
 Actually, one of my staff has been stealing money from me.
 So we're beating his punk ass.
 Relax, junior.
 Fish gets some leeway.
 Her staff are rough characters, need firm handling.
 So this isn't a social visit, then.
 Unfortunately not.
 Brass sent me by to talk to you about the Wayne murders.
 Terrible thing.
 Junior, if you're worried, go back there and see if anyone wants to press charges.
 - If that's okay with you, Fish.
 - Oh, I don't mind at all, Harvey.
 - Oswald, whoa.
 - Yeah, take it easy, Penguin.
 You know I don't like to be called that.
 Ooh.
 Scary.
 How's everybody doing? Who are you? James Gordon, G.
C.
P.
D.
 Oh, you came with Harvey, huh? Glad to know you, James.
 I'm Butch Gilzean.
 Drop the bat.
 Oh, come on, now.
 Oswald and Raul here were just having a little fun, weren't you, boys? - All in fun.
 - No problem.
 Fun.
 You're a new guy, huh? How do you like Gotham so far? Well enough.
 See you around.
 Oh, hey.
 Everything all right back there? It's always good to see you, Harvey.
 And look at you and your excellent suit.
 You know, I'm so happy you don't have to wear that silly uniform anymore.
 - You told me it looked good.
 - I lied.
 - You ready to rock and roll? - Uh Barbara, I'm beat.
 Do we really have to go to this thing? No, of course not.
 - Thank you.
 - You owe me.
 So talk to me.
 We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.
 I made a promise to Bruce Wayne, and I can't deliver.
 But you will.
 I don't know.
 Maybe I'm out of my depth.
 Hey, I very much doubt you are out of your depth.
 But even if you are, you know how to swim, don't you? Yes, I do.
 So swim.
 I'll swim.
 You're right.
 Are you hungry? I'm all right.
 I had a few dogs.
 When I'm Mrs.
 Gordon and you're living here all the time I'm gonna put you on a proper healthy diet.
 Mm-hm.
 I've got a lead.
 Meet me at Fourth and Grundy in an hour.
 On my way.
 Hey.
 You all right? Couple drinks.
 I'll be fine.
 Bullock Fish Mooney heard from one of her fences a guy tried to sell him an antique.
 Four strand pearl necklace with gold settings, one strand broken.
 - Like Martha Wayne was wearing.
 - Mm.
 Guy's name is Mario Pepper.
 Career street thug.
 Long sheet for robbery, assault, rape, extortion, drug dealing.
 Nice guy.
 Hi.
 - What's your name? - Ivy.
 Ivy, is daddy home? You don't wanna talk to daddy.
 Why's that, Ivy? He's mean.
 Hey, who is it? Mario Pepper, we need to talk.
 I've done nothing.
 So it'll be a pleasant talk.
30? I was here at home with my family.
 That's right.
 He was here.
 A pearl necklace sound familiar? No.
 Then I guess you don't mind we, uh, take a look around the place.
 You need a warrant.
 You're a felon on parole.
 All we need is reasonable cause.
 Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Out of the way! Thanks.
 What kind of guy are we dealing with? Probable? I had to.
 We got him.
 We got him.
 Mario Pepper was framed by Fish Mooney and the cops.
 I saw Ms.
 Mooney with Martha Wayne's necklace.
 She was discussing how to get it into Pepper's home, inside a bag of drugs.
 This was shortly after she met with Detectives Bullock and Gordon from the homicide squad.
 Mooney works with Carmine Falcone's mob.
 You saying Falcone had the Waynes killed? - I'm just telling you what I saw.
 - Why snitch on your own boss? I confess, that poor orphan boy pricked my conscience.
 No.
 You wanna push Fish out, huh? That's beside the point.
 I've done my civic duty.
 Good day to you both.
 You kept your promise.
 Thank you.
 I'm sorry you didn't see a trial.
 That's okay.
 Renee, long time.
 Yeah.
 Sorry to drop by unexpected like this.
 How have you been? I'm good.
 - You? - All good.
 You're running an art gallery now, right? - Yeah.
 - That's so cool.
 And I'm engaged.
 Yeah.
 James Gordon, huh? - That's why I'm here.
 - Oh? The G.
C.
P.
D.
 framed Mario Pepper for the murder of the Waynes.
 - What? - They framed and killed an innocent man.
 And you're here to tell me that James was in on this? - Yes.
 - And what's your proof? I can't tell you, but it's the truth.
 James Gordon is not a good guy.
 You deserve better.
 James Gordon is the most honest man I've ever met.
 He's not capable of doing that.
 - You sure you know what he's capable of? - Yes, I know him.
 Does he know you? Don't.
 Like I know you? Here you are.
 Barbara, what's wrong? Did you frame Mario Pepper? - No.
 - I knew it.
 - Who told you? - Doesn't matter, as long as it's not true.
 - It's not.
 Who told you it was? - Nobody.
 Bee, I know when you're lying.
 Montoya.
 What's your evidence that Pepper was framed? I was wrong to reveal that information to Barbara.
 - We're old friends.
 - I asked what evidence you have.
 You'll see the evidence when we get you and your crooked friends into a courtroom.
 We're working on it.
 Save your energy.
 If Pepper was framed, I'll find out.
 Hey, you got a problem here, Gordon? And then you and you just need to stay out of my way.
 - Mrs.
 Pepper - Go away.
 Ma'am, if your husband was innocent, you need to talk to me.
 If your husband didn't kill the Waynes, how'd he come to have the necklace? You bastards planted it on him? Bastards.
 Alice, how would the police have the necklace? - We didn't kill the Waynes.
 - So you say.
 God knows my husband had his demons, but he never killed nobody.
 Can I see his shoes? Shoes? - This is all of them? - Uh-huh.
 Damn.
 Framed? How you figure? You were there.
 We framed him? Somebody could've planted the necklace on Pepper.
 - Mooney could've set the whole thing up.
 - Why? To cover up for the real killer.
 Mooney works for Falcone.
 Maybe Falcone wanted the Waynes killed.
 Wait, wait, wait.
 Why would such a nutty idea even enter your head? Montoya from MCU.
 That pill-head looney-bird? What's her proof? - Wouldn't tell me.
 Didn't trust me.
 - She doesn't have any.
 If they did, they'd have used it.
 Pepper didn't wear shiny shoes.
 He didn't own any shiny shoes.
 Shiny shoes.
 Mother of God.
 Shiny shoes.
 Just suppose for a moment, just suppose Pepper was innocent.
 I killed him.
 - We killed him.
 - We killed him.
 We'd lose our jobs at the very least.
 The case is closed.
 Forget about it.
 - Even if the real killers are still out there? - Yes.
 This is very perilous stuff you're messing with.
 Listen to me for once, Jim.
 Forget about it.
 Detective Gordon.
 Tell Mooney I'm here.
 - Regarding what, shall I say? - Mario Pepper.
 Mario-- - May I ask why? - No.
 No.
 Yes.
 Heh.
 None of my business.
 James Gordon.
 How nice.
 The day I met you, when I was out back there with your boys what did you and Harvey talk about? Shouldn't you ask Harvey? He's your partner.
 - I'm afraid he might lie.
 - Hmm.
 He might.
 And you think I'll tell you the truth? You just did.
 James, wait.
 You have a little danger in your eye.
 I wonder what you plan to do with that.
 You'll have to wait and see.
 I hate surprises.
 Detective Bullock? Miss Kean.
 Um, James went for a walk last night, and he never came back.
 Have you heard from him? I'm really worried about him.
 He's on a stake-out.
 Yeah, his phone probably ran out of juice, is all.
 Oh.
 Right, well, that's a relief.
 - Thank you.
 - No problem.
 Wait, wait, wait.
 Shut up.
 Hey, what are you doing? - Over here, you'll get a better angle.
 - What? - You're a director now? - Don't get fresh.
 I'm just saying.
 Hey, Butch.
 Harvey.
 Who told you we'd be here? Everybody knows this is where you take your problems.
 - That's my partner you got there.
 - Ex-partner.
 Oh.
 Let me talk to Fish.
 I'm not afraid of death so much as I am of dying.
 I, um, wanna die how my father died, peacefully, in his sleep.
 Not like his screaming, terrified, passengers.
 - Yeah? - Bullock showed up at the plant.
 - Wants to talk to you.
 - Put him on.
 Give me a moment, kid.
 You're doing good.
 - Fish? - Speaking.
 Don't be like that.
 Listen, you gotta let my boy go.
 - How long we been friends? - For a long time.
 Until today.
 I did a big favor for you and your pals and now it's gonna blow up in my face on account of your stupidity.
 The kid's not your problem.
 He was hipped to the frame by Major Crimes, they'll be coming after you.
 - How did they get onto me? - The usual way, I guess.
 Somebody talked.
 Huh.
 Not one of my people.
 That's what everybody says.
 - True.
 - Listen, you gotta let my boy go.
 Hmm? You kill my partner, I gotta come after you.
 I don't wanna do it, but how am I gonna look you kill my partner, I don't make a move? All right.
 But promise me that you'll keep him under control.
 - I promise.
 - Cool.
 Put Butch on, please.
 Yeah, boss.
 That son-of-a-bitch just threatened me.
 You hang him up with his partner.
 You got it.
 Hey, how you doing? I'm good.
 We're going home.
 - Yeah? - I'm just glad everything could work out-- Cops.
 Bless your heart.
 Would you be a sweet boy and rub my feet? Give me a moment, darling.
 I haven't forgotten you.
 I like you.
 You're funny.
 Now, this amateur nonsense is a good sign.
 There used to be some discipline.
 Falcone is getting old and soft.
 It's time.
 Somebody has to take over, it might as well be me.
 Yes, it might as well.
 And you? You're like a son to me.
 You know that, Oswald? I feel that way also.
 Which is what I don't understand.
 After all I've done for you and right when I'm on the verge of great things, you betray me? Why would you betray your mother? I don't know what you mean.
 It was you.
 You snitched to the MCU.
 You wanna know how I know? Because only you saw me with the pearls, no one else.
 It was Gilzean.
 He's the snitch.
 No.
 - Gilzean is loyal.
 - So am I.
 I would open a vein right here and now if you asked me to.
 Go on, then.
 Open one.
 I, uh-- I was speaking poetically.
 Prove it.
 Prove your loyalty, my little Penguin.
 Please, Miss Mooney.
 Please, don't.
 You broke my heart! Are we rolling? How you doing? Been better.
 Thanks for trying to help.
 Wish I hadn't.
 - Did you just slap my hand? - Hey, Butch! Save your breath.
 If it was up to me, you'd get a bullet in the head and a decent funeral.
 But Fish has her ways.
 Yo, Franky! Showtime.
 Don Falcone.
 Forgive me, young man, I forget what your name is.
 Or perhaps I never knew it.
 Gilzean, sir.
 Gilzean.
 Tell Miss Mooney she's too impetuous.
 If she wants to kill policemen, she has to ask permission.
 Yes, sir.
 There are rules.
 Cut them down.
 That's right, there are rules.
 It's good to meet you at last, James.
 I knew your father very well.
 The best DA this city ever had.
 He and I understood each other.
 There was respect.
 Friendship, even.
 Friendship? Trust me, that's the only reason you're alive now.
 Blood doesn't lie.
 I know that when you leave here, you'll do the right thing.
 I will.
 I'll tell what I know.
 Which is what? I know that you own the police department, probably the mayor too.
 And I was sure that you had the Waynes killed.
 But if you did, you wouldn't risk letting me live, would you? Then again, how did Fish Mooney come to have Martha Wayne's necklace? - A replica? - Yes.
 But if you didn't have them killed, why frame Mario Pepper? Or are you covering up for somebody else? Who knows who killed the Waynes.
 Some lowlife.
 We needed a culprit before the funeral.
 Pepper was sacrificed so that the people of Gotham would see swift justice done.
 So they can feel safe and secure.
 - And that matters so much to you.
 - Of course.
 I'm a businessman.
 You can't have organized crime without law and order.
 I love this city, and I see it going to hell.
 But I won't let it fall apart without a fight.
 You make a life of crime sound very noble.
 You have a hard head, James, just like your father.
 Don't be self-righteous.
 Don't be arrogant.
 You want me to keep quiet about all this.
 Gotham is on a knife edge.
 What do you suppose bringing down city hall and the police force will do? Even if you could.
 Would it make things better? - Lookit, Jim.
 - I'm listening.
 I wasn't being honest with you.
 But you weren't ready for the truth.
 You didn't tell me because you were ashamed.
 Why are we stopping here? No, please.
 Please, I beg of you.
 Shut up! This is the fool that snitched to Montoya and Allen.
 Falcone wants you to walk him to the end of that pier and put a bullet in his head.
 Then everybody knows you're with the program.
 And if I don't? Then I'm supposed to take you out and him too.
 Here's the thing, Jim, I like you.
 I might not have the stomach to do it, but I'll try.
 Because if I don't, someone will get to you quick enough.
 Then they're gonna get to me, probably Barbara as well.
 Who knows what you told her.
 - I told her nothing.
 - You think Falcone cares? - Come on, you've killed people before.
 - That was war! This is war! We're at war with scumbags like him.
 Sometimes in a war, you gotta do a bad thing to do good, right? So, do you do this bad thing, or do you die and maybe your girl dies? I might be lackadaisical, hmm? But that's not a tough call.
 Walk.
 Please, Mr.
 Gordon, just let me live.
 I'll do whatever you say, I'll be your slave for life.
 Listen to me, there's a war coming, a terrible war.
 Falcone is losing his grip, and his rivals are hungry.
 There will be chaos, rivers of blood in the streets, I know it.
 I can see it coming.
 I'm clever that way.
 And I can help you.
 - I can be a spy-- - Shut up! Turn around.
 For God's sake, have mercy.
 Don't ever come back to Gotham.
 Attaboy.
 Oh, my God, James.
 I've been so worried.
 What happened to you? Hey! Master Bruce! Get your bloody ass down off there! How many times have I told you? Why were you up on the roof? I'm learning to conquer fear.
 Fear doesn't need conquering.
 Fear tells you where the edge is.
 Fear is a good thing.
 And you think I haven't told him that, do you? - You came here for a reason, I imagine.
 - Yes.
 Mario Pepper didn't kill your parents.
 He was framed by the police department and the mob working together.
 We killed an innocent man.
 Right.
 So who did it, then? - I don't know.
 - I see.
 Well, sterling work there, then, mate.
 Yes, I'm sorry.
 Don't be.
 I'm glad he's still alive.
 I wanna see him again.
 Bruce, I'm asking you to give me a second chance.
 I'm going to find out who killed your parents and why.
 And I'm gonna clean up the damn police department if I can.
 But I can only do that from the inside.
 So I'm asking you to stay silent about what I've told you.
 Your call.
 Right, well, that's sort of convenient, isn't it? Alfred! Thank you.
   

                



                


                    			 There's a war coming.
 A terrible war.
 There will be chaos.
 Rivers of the blood in the streets, I know it.
 I can see it coming.
 It's time.
 Somebody has to take over, it might as well be me.
 - My name's James Gordon.
 I'm a detective.
 - My name is Bruce Wayne.
 I promise I will find the man who did this.
 Stop or I'll shoot! He was framed.
 To cover up for the real killer.
 I know that you own the police department, probably the mayor.
 You can't have organized crime without law and order.
 You snitched, my little Penguin.
 - Please.
 - Falcone wants a bullet in his head.
 Then we know you're with the program.
 Don't ever come back to Gotham.
 Ah.
 There you are.
 Been all over the bloody house looking for you.
 - What are you doing? - Nothing.
 You, my old son, are a terrible liar.
 What you got there? Come on, show me.
 Oh, my God, you stupid little boy! Aw.
 It's all right.
 I'm sorry.
 It's gonna be all right.
 Hi, I'm Patti.
 This is Doug.
 We're with the mayor's homeless outreach project.
 - We have some sandwiches and soup.
 - We got cookies, candy.
 Who here likes chocolate? Ha-ha-ha.
 - Ain't you hungry, Cat? Yeah, dig in.
 Take a sandwich.
 Sure, go ahead.
 Plenty for everyone.
 Haven't had a sandwich in forever.
 Yeah, sure.
 Take two.
 - Hey! - Hey, lady! - Oh, fudge! - Don't worry, I'll go.
 Slow down, there, buckaroo.
 Stop struggling.
 I got you one, but I dropped it.
 Yeah, thanks.
 - Where is everybody? - I don't know.
 - What do you think? - I think it's been a long shift.
 We give this bum three hours, then we knock off.
 - He was a vet.
 - I salute his service.
 Now he's a dead bum.
 People shoot bums all the time.
 We might as well look for the tooth fairy.
 - Hey, guys.
 - Hey, Bo.
 How come you weren't here? - Whoa, whoa.
 Good morning to you too.
 - Where were you? At a restaurant down the street.
 Chez Vous.
 They had some homeless junkie kid fell through their front window last night.
 - Been taking care of that.
 - This is a potential murder.
 You're first responder.
 Supposed to preserve the crime scene.
 He's got a point.
 The restaurant that pays me 50 a month to look out for them.
 So I'm gonna babysit a dead wino? I got a family.
 He's got a point.
 - Why'd the kid jump through the window? - He was high.
 - Did you ask him? - Why am I the bad guy? I'm asking about the kid because maybe he's related to the victim.
 - You're not a bad guy.
 Just a bad cop.
 - Oh! Who are you talking to'! - Hold on.
 - Come on! Come on! You want it? Any day.
 Hey! Oh! And then Zeb and Smoke went right down.
 And that's when that wacky dude just shot Soldier.
 I realized I needed to get out of there.
 I ran and I ran, and that's how I ended up on the floor of that restaurant.
 - She used a pen? - I swear.
 A big pen.
 But listen, this is not the first time.
 Street kids have been disappearing for weeks now.
 By the dozen.
 No one knows why.
 - First we heard about it.
 - Why would you? Nobody gives a crap about us.
 - Look, that is proof.
 - That's not proof, that's a scab.
 Listen, Macky, we're grown-ups.
 We're smarter than you.
 - Man, whatever.
 - You're gonna tell the truth! It was you, wasn't it? It was you that killed that poor old man.
 You're gonna tell me the truth, or I swear to God, I'll beat it out of you! - That man was a war veteran! - Cat was there.
 Cat saw the whole thing.
 - Ask Cat.
 - Relax.
 No one'll beat you.
 Who's Cat? What do you mean? Isn't that what I just said I was gonna do right now? Come here.
 Come here.
 - He is 16.
 - Yeah, and G-foot, 220.
 He can take a punch.
 Look, I wasn't gonna beat him.
 Just scare him.
 But if I did want to, I could.
 - It would be my prerogative.
 - It's illegal.
 Ille--? How now so righteous? Hm? Not long since you put a man in the river.
 You wanna say that a little louder? - Not everybody heard.
 - Since then you've been a pain in the ass.
 You think I or anybody here gives a crap about a dead snitch or your conscience? - We got our own problems.
 - Conscience.
 Call it what you want, I'm gonna do what's right.
 - You're beginning to irritate me.
 - Get your hands off me.
 Hey! Watch the shoes, clown.
 Shift's over.
 Come on.
 Come on.
 Come on, seriously.
 My pretty baby When I first came home Thank you so much, guys.
 Truly.
 - I'm grateful.
 I've been waiting for hours.
 - No kidding.
 - Look like you crawled out of a cemetery.
 - Smells like it too.
 Open a window back there.
 - There you go.
 - Yeah.
 That's-- Thank you.
 Forgive me, I am somewhat disheveled.
 A temporary setback, I assure you.
 - Thank you so much.
 - What the hell happened to you, anyhow? It was my own fault.
 Foolish arrogance led me astray.
 But I learned my lessons.
 I'll be back.
 Stronger and smarter than ever.
 - Good luck with that, bro.
 - Here I am riding around in a lovely truck.
 Sharing an ice-cold beer with my new friends.
 My luck's already turned, right? Dude, anyone ever tell you? When you walk, you look like a penguin.
 No.
 Nobody's ever told me that.
 He's saying he has a right to stop me from beating on a mope.
 - Damn right.
 - How am I supposed to work with this? Look, Jim, it's not like I can order you to break the law, but this is Gotham.
 You don't bend, you'll get broke.
 - I understand.
 - I thought you were with the program? - He is.
 - Let's get back to work.
 Where you at? If the boy we have is telling the truth there's a couple kidnappers out there abducting homeless children.
 In numbers.
 They lured them with a food truck from the mayor's homeless outreach project.
 Then they drugged them with a jab from a big pen.
 Why would anyone want to abduct scraggly-ass orphans in bulk? Where's the market? They're on the street because no one wants them anyway.
 If they said they were snatching cute girls, I'd believe them.
 Why would anyone want a lard-ass like Macky? What is it, Ed? Guess what I found.
 I did a blood test on him and he had high levels of ATP.
 What's ATP? It's a fast-acting knockout drug.
 Used to use it at the old Arkham Asylum.
 Bring down troublesome patients.
 It's hard to get, no recreational use.
 - Okay.
 That's interesting.
 - Anything else? Thank you, Ed.
 Ahem.
 Thank you, Ed.
 Get to work.
 And keep this quiet.
 No press.
 Not a word.
 Shouldn't we tell the public what's going on? Warn them? Department policy.
 We don't advertise this kind of stuff.
 Causes panic.
 The headlines will read, Gotham's Kids Snatched.
 Which would be true.
 No press.
 That's an order.
 Follow up on the drug.
 The ATP.
 And the Arkham connection.
 - Arkham's been closed for, like, 10 years.
 - Yeah, 15.
 The drug suppliers might still be in business.
 Uh, this happened on Fish Mooney's turf.
 Do you wanna see if it's safe for us to go back there, or is, uh, she still mad at us? It's a good question.
 Bravo! Bravo! Don Falcone, what a wonderful surprise.
 Welcome.
 Thank you, my dear.
 - Can we talk? - Of course.
 - Give me a moment to clear the place.
 - No, no.
 No need to spoil the fun.
 Men who are about to die are very honest.
 It pays to listen to them.
 That's some toast.
 I spoke with your man Cobblepot before he died.
 Odd little fellow.
 Perceptive.
 He told me the death of the Waynes would bring troubled times for our family and Gotham.
 Ugh.
 What did he know? Business is good as ever.
 No, he was right.
 The Waynes and the Falcones were the pillars of the same house.
 We understood each other.
 Now that they're gone, everything is out of balance.
 And the Wayne empire is in flux.
 Who knows who'll end up in control.
 The Maroni family senses weakness.
 They'll start making moves and every criminal in the city will start making moves.
 Please, don't lose any sleep over Maroni.
 He's number two for a reason.
 I never lose sleep over my enemies.
 It's my friends that keep me awake.
 - Oh.
 - Cobblepot told me you say I'm old and soft and ready to be taken out, and you're the one to take me.
 Don Falcone, I would never, ever say that.
 I only have deep love and respect for you.
 You have been like a father to me.
 I'm so happy to hear that.
 Let's forget all about it, then.
 The babbling of a condemned man.
 Ahem.
 Enough business.
 How have you been, my dear? Thriving, I hope.
 Yes.
 Good.
 I'm good.
 Which of these is your lover? Please, my heart has been broken far too many times for that nonsense.
 Hm.
 I heard you had a lover.
 Well, if you're referring to the boy that I keep around for exercise my lover, he is not.
 - What's your name? - Lazlo, sir.
 Lazlo, be good to this woman, she's very precious to me.
 If you break her heart, you break my heart.
 Yes, sir.
 Give me your hand.
 Thank you for being honest.
 It means a lot to me.
 It shows wisdom and humility.
 Out! Everyone out! Never, never in his life my son is away this long.
 Nightclubs is his business.
 Such hours.
 But, always, he comes home to his mother.
 His clothes are here.
 My son would never leave his clothes.
 Oh.
 So elegant he is.
 Yes, I show you.
 Damn, Mooney and the cops must've had him killed.
 Looks like.
 But snitches get bumped.
 That's life.
 But they won't get away with it.
 Not as easy as they think.
 - You take things too personally, know that? - Yeah, I do.
 That was a good snitch.
 - What are we--? - Nothing.
 Mrs.
 Cobblepot-- Kapelput.
 Mrs.
 Kapelput do you know anyone who might wanna do your son harm? Harm? No, I would feel it.
 A mother feels these things.
 It's a woman.
 Some painted slut has him in her clutch.
 A woman? You think? I'm sure.
 So handsome he is.
 And so naÃ¯ve.
 Uh, who are you, again? Uh, detectives with Major Crimes Unit, ma'am.
 Oh, G.
C.
P.
D.
 - Like that.
 - But honest.
 Mm.
 Boss, don't get mad at me but I know that look.
 Now is too early to make a move on Falcone.
 I know.
 Not yet.
 I need more money, more men, more territory.
 I know.
 I'll play this thing loyal and bide my time.
 But I swear, Butch on my sainted mother's grave, someday soon I am gonna kill that old man with my bare hands and my teeth.
 I'll be holding your shoes.
 I just wish that Penguin was still alive.
 I didn't make that little punk suffer near badly enough.
 Excuse me, sir? I couldn't help but notice the sign on your trailer.
 Is it still for rent? - 100 bucks a week.
 It ain't much but-- - I'll take it.
 - You don't wanna look at it first? - No.
 I'm not fussy.
 - It's all yours.
 - The key? Hey, sweet truck.
 You got that big Hemi in there? Yes.
 Yup.
 That big Hemi's in there.
 Somewhere.
 Uh, sir, the key? It's in the door.
 Okay.
 What's up, players? - You got any smokes? - No.
 Where are we? Damned if I know.
 I think we're dead.
 Harvey.
 Jim.
 How marvelous.
 Are you still mad at us? No.
 Please.
 I'm quite fond of you.
 And you intrigue me.
 I knew I'd regret killing you as soon as I gave the word.
 But you know me.
 I'm feisty.
 What do you know about a man and woman abducting street kids on your turf? No foreplay with you.
 Hm? Figures.
 But you got with the program.
 Killed Penguin your own bad self.
 I was surprised.
 Straight arrow like you.
 - I guess you misjudged me.
 - I guess I did.
 You're just a little sinner like the rest of us.
 I'm almost kind of sad about that.
 We're looking for a man and a woman.
 Middle-aged.
 White.
 Targeting children under 16.
 They use a poisoned pen, if you can believe it.
 Oh.
 Used to be, there was only a market for nice-looking girls.
 That's what I said.
 But now there's a new buyer overseas that'll take anyone young and healthy.
 Overseas where? Who's they? Nobody knows.
 - What do they want them for? - Nobody knows.
 And no one cares to know.
 Ta-da, moo sh Sorry.
 Go on.
 They drugged them with a big pen? That is so creepy.
 Ah, you don't wanna hear this stuff, it's depressing.
 What do they use them for? The children.
 Nobody seems to know.
 And we can't say a damn thing to the press.
 Bad PR.
 - I can't believe the system is so corrupt.
 - You have no idea.
 What do you mean? Oh.
 Figure of speech, I guess.
 Did something happen you're not telling me about? These last couple of weeks you've been different.
 Troubled.
 Mm.
 No.
 Been having trouble sleeping, I guess.
 The newspapers must get anonymous tips all the time.
 Sure.
 Yeah.
 You mean call it in myself? Heh.
 No, I can't do that.
 - Gotham Gazette? The news room? - Wait.
 No.
 I can't talk long.
 Somebody is abducting homeless children off the streets.
 And the cops are trying to keep it quiet.
 Go talk to Captain Sarah Essen of G.
C.
P.
D.
 She has got a kid in custody who can tell you the whole story.
 - End the call.
 - I gotta go.
 Listen, Barbara, when I tell you stuff, it's between us.
 You can't do what you just did.
 - It was the right thing to do.
 - Not the point.
 What is the point? You're right, it was the right thing to do.
 Don't do it again.
 Okay? Yes, boss.
 Gotham spirals ever downward.
 Mayor James under attack.
 Vows swift action.
 Points finger at police department's sluggish response.
 Etcetera.
 - It's just ink.
 - Did you give them this? - Me? - You've done it before.
 On my own case? Never.
 It'd be a very stupid thing to do.
 Jim? I didn't call it in.
 - I swear.
 - Another mystery.
 We have a thin lead on the case, if you'd like to hear it, ma'am.
 There's only three companies in Gotham that stock this ATP.
 You need a special license to buy it.
 Chances are, one is crooked.
 We're looking to lean hard on all three like they are crooked.
 See which one pops.
 That was sneaky good.
 - Almost couldn't tell you were lying.
 - I wasn't lying.
 Good morning, Judge Baker.
 Thank you, sir.
 Yes, all three.
 Wellzine, Dracotech, and Quillan Pharma.
 You guys have screwed me.
 Against my better judgment I sell you the juice.
 I let you guys use my storage space because, No problem, you said.
 And now look.
 Heat.
 White hot heat.
 No problems, my friend.
 We're here to take the merch away.
 You'll be clean as a whistle.
 March? They're children, damn it.
 They're human beings.
 Didn't I tell you to check on them I want another five large.
 - But we had a deal already.
 - I gotta stand up for what is right, here.
 Be fair, sir.
 We don't have that kind of cash on hand.
 That's your problem.
 I can wait.
 - I thought you was worried about the heat.
 - If heat arrives in the meantime I can get rid of the evidence very quickly.
 We have an obligation to deliver.
 The Dollmaker doesn't tolerate failure.
 - We need those children.
 - Well, that's also your problem.
 Ha-ha.
 Ah! No.
 Hey, hey-- This is totally inappropriate.
 I mean, we were having a business discussion here.
 You weren't being fair.
 Oh, gosh.
 Cops.
 You didn't call the Gazette, but did your girl call? - Yeah.
 - I knew it.
 - I didn't know she was gonna call them.
 - Seriously, you gotta control your woman.
 I kind of like her the way she is.
 These high-class temperamental broads need firm handling, trust me.
 - Trust you? On women? - Damn right.
 All varieties.
 From house fraus to movie stars.
 I love them all.
 Now, you, let me guess, high school sweetheart then a bunch of hos overseas only made you sad.
 And then there's Barbara.
 - Pretty much.
 - You, my friend, are a monkey riding a race horse.
 Good evening.
 May I help you? Detectives Gordon and Bullock.
 We need to speak to whoever's in charge.
 Of course.
 Mr.
 Quillan, detectives are here to see you.
 Oh? Wow.
 Detectives, hey.
 What's up? Nothing serious, I hope.
 Cut the crap.
 We have a warrant to search the premises.
 We know what you're doing.
 Then you know some boring stuff, then.
 I mean, what are you talking about? - You're peddling ATP to kid-snatchers.
 - Oh, my gosh.
 No.
 I mean, we used to stock ATP, but not since the Arkham Asylum closed.
 Uh, I heard that the Wayne Foundation is planning on reopening the old place again.
 But now that the Waynes are dead, I guess everything's up in the air.
 What a world, eh? Nobody's safe.
 - Jim! - Go, go! Where the hell were you? Get rid of them now.
 Then hose down the room.
 Ah! Zack.
 Freeze.
 Ash! No! On behalf of all the citizens of Gotham, I wanna thank you gentlemen.
 From the bottom of my heart.
 And I wanna promise you, kids we will take care of you as if you were our own children.
 But here's the thing.
 The people who victimized these kids are still out there.
 And hundreds of vulnerable youngsters are still living rough on our streets.
 Alone.
 Unprotected.
 And let's face it, that's the real crime here.
 So, what are we going to do to help these kids? Yesterday, I made a phone call to juvenile services and the G.
C.
P.
D.
 to initiate a humane but tough love program to get these kids off the streets and into the loving arms of juvenile services.
 - I think that went very well.
 - I think so.
 - A small toast, Your Honor? - You read my mind.
 Mr.
 Mayor, where are you sending all the children that get rounded up? Foster homes for the cute, undamaged ones.
 Upstate for the rest.
 Upstate? The Alpenia Youth Corrections Facility.
 A fine institute.
 Prison, in other words.
 Forgive me, Your Honor.
 - Detective Gordon's our house firebrand.
 - No, no, no, that's okay.
 Jim.
 May I call you Jim? Half the petty crime in this city is homeless kids.
 They need structure.
 People who care for them, for the greater good of Gotham and for the children, see? I see you're using the child-snatchers as a pretext to lock up children without a trial.
 Thank you, my friend.
 Valuable input.
 Most refreshing.
 Yo, Gordon, a man's been waiting for you upstairs.
 Mr.
 Pennyworth? Alfred, please.
 It's bedlam, isn't it? Rough job you got.
 Best job in the world.
 I wonder if it might be convenient for you to visit us tomorrow.
 Of course.
 - Why? ls something wrong? - I don't know.
 Never had a child before.
 Nor me.
 The boy respects you.
 Tea time, shall we say? Tea time.
 - Name? - Ma'am, there's been a mistake.
 I'm not meant to go upstate.
 I need James Gordon.
 He's a cop.
 You're allowed a phone call when you get upstate.
 Name.
 I need to talk to him now.
 - He'll thank you for it.
 - Not happening.
 Name.
 Bite me, Pig-erina.
 Jane Doe.
 Hey.
 Relax, kid.
 Juvie's not so bad.
 First week, whatever you do, don't make friends with anyone that's friendly.
 When you get into a fight, go for their eyes.
 Hiya, kids.
 How you doing? Are you ready to go on a big adventure? Sit down, young lady.
 I said sit down.
 Like, now.
 Okay.
 Next naughty child to stand up gets a black mark.
 Right here.
 One or two or three I can explain that.
 But a busload? A whole busload of the little bastards.
 What am I supposed to say? Oops? Just tell me it wasn't them, I'm begging you.
 Just tell me it wasn't the snatchers.
 Bus driver was a man.
 Guard was a woman.
 It could be them.
 You're killing me.
 You're killing me.
 We're working it, Your Honor.
 I told you everything I know.
 I told you.
 You see that man there? He doesn't like it when I beat people.
 But for you, no objection.
 Why is that? Math.
 The lives of 30 children versus one scumbag.
 So I can beat you like a bongo drum, and St.
 Jim here won't intervene.
 Give us something.
 Okay, okay! No! The truck.
 When they came to pick up the last bunch of kids.
 On the side of it, there was a picture, like a logo.
 I didn't wanna say before because it'll give a bad impression.
 - It doesn't reflect really-- - What was it? There's a blue plate and a silver fork.
 - A plate and a fork? - Yeah.
 You know, like - Like a catering company, like food'? - Like that, I mean-- You know, but-- I mean, that doesn't mean It doesn't mean what? Look, I don't know what they do to them.
 Ah! Hey.
 Hey.
 All right.
 Draw the logo.
 Uncuff him.
 There you go, kids.
 Don't worry, everything's gonna be all right.
 That's right.
 Come on.
 - Come on.
 Come on.
 Come on.
 - Come on.
 Go.
 Funny thing.
 By my count, according to the sheet they gave us, we're one short.
 Me too.
 Maybe there's one on the bus.
 Hm.
 Shh.
 Nope.
 Weird.
 Must be a miscount someplace.
 Never mind.
 We got more than enough.
 - We did good.
 - Indeed we did.
 The Dollmaker will be so pleased with us.
 All right, thanks.
 Nothing.
 You? Apparently no companies in Gotham have a plate and a fork as their logo.
 Selling children for food.
 Is such a thing even possible? We've got officers searching all the trucks on every bridge and tunnel.
 But they had a three-hour window.
 We can only pray they stayed in the city.
 If not, they can be any place by night fall.
 Scum-sucking toads.
 Where are they? It's not a blue plate.
 It's not a fork either.
 It's a trident.
 When you stow this on the ship, make sure there's room for the doors to open.
 - The ship's crew has-- Let me out! Let me out! ls anybody there? Quiet in there! Hush.
 Hush.
 My eyes! She scratched me.
 Oh! Come on, follow me.
 Hm.
 Let me look.
 Mm.
 Uh It's nothing.
 It's a scratch.
 We'll get you the doctor.
 - You'll be right as rain in no time.
 - You sure? - What was that? - Hang on.
 Well You are a very naughty little girl.
 Hi.
 - What's your name? - Why is that your business? Jim.
 Where are the kids? Where are they? He's not been sleeping.
 And when he does, he has these nightmares.
 Now he's hurting himself.
 Burning himself.
 He's cutting.
 - Is he getting professional help? - Oh, you mean psychiatrists? Oh, no, none, he won't have them.
 No psychiatrists, that's a rule.
 You make the rules, don't you? You're his guardian.
 Now, Bruce's father gave me very firm orders was him and his missus to die.
 Now I will raise the boy the way his father told me to raise him.
 Which is how? Trust him to choose his own course.
 He is, after all, a Wayne.
 Sounds like a recipe for disaster.
 - What do you want me to do? - He wants you to talk some sense into me.
 Haven't I told you to stop creeping up on people like that.
 It's bloody rude.
 All right then, Bruce.
 Talk to me.
 I'm perfectly fine.
 Alfred's a worrywart.
 What'd you do to your hand? I burned it.
 Listen to me, Bruce.
 You've been through a terrible experience.
 Talking to someone can be very helpful.
 You must have seen terrible things in the war, does it--? Does it help you to talk about what you saw? Yes, a little.
 You're not a very good liar.
 - Bruce, you're hurting yourself.
 - I'm testing myself.
 Different.
 But I appreciate your concern.
 I've been following your adventures in the newspapers.
 I feel very sorry for all those poor children.
 Me too.
 - I'll give you some money to give to them.
 - I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, Bruce.
 What way does it work? Those children need someone who cares for them.
 Like you have right here.
 Money won't buy that.
 There must be something I can do.
 What about clothes? They all looked awfully ragged.
 They did, didn't they? After all this? You're sending us upstate? - Selina-- - Cat.
 Cat, even if you didn't have outstanding warrants you're 13.
 No parents or guardians.
 - That's not true.
 I have a mom.
 - Says here she's deceased.
 That's not true.
 She's alive.
 Someplace.
 Be that as it may, we're not allowed to put you back on the street.
 - It's for your own well-being.
 - Heh.
 Have you been there? Upstate? - Yes.
 - Then you know.
 You know.
 Go get Detective James Gordon.
 He works here.
 Cat.
 - Police are very busy people-- - Go get him.
 Or I'll say you touched me.
 Excuse me? James Gordon.
 I'm gonna scream in about three seconds.
 Hello? Ah.
 Yes, this is he.
 Well, I'm looking at your son right now, and he doesn't look good.
 Madam, I assure you, your son is not trying to trick you.
 No, he will die a horrible death unless he-- No, no.
 No.
 Really, truly, he isnât joking.
 I'm not joking.
 I will poke his eyeballs out.
 And-- How can you say that? You saw the video I sent.
 I'm not lying.
 Heh.
 Madam-- Madam.
 Calm yourself.
 If 10,000 is too much, I'm sure we can-- Hello? Hello? Well, that's disappointing.
 She didn't believe me.
 You must be quite the scamp.
 I got it.
 Hello again, young lady.
 - How can I help you? - We need to talk.
 So now you wanna talk, huh? Okay.
 It's all right.
 - Selina, is it? - Cat.
 Cat.
 You're Macky's friend? Yeah, I know Macky.
 Those bastards nearly got you twice, huh? You're quite a survivor.
 You have no idea.
 Suppose I had something you really, really wanted.
 If I gave it to you, could you get me out of here? - What do you got? - I've been watching you.
 You're a friend of the boy.
 You're not like the rest of these crooks.
 The boy? Bruce? What do you mean you've been watching me? The Mario Pepper guy was a patsy, huh? - What makes you say that? - Could you? Could you get me out? It's possible.
 I saw who really killed the Waynes.
 Saw him clear as day.
   

                



                


                    			 There's a war coming.
 A terrible war.
 There will be chaos rivers of blood in the streets, I know it.
 I can see it coming.
 It's time.
 Somebody has to take over, it might as well be me.
 My name's James Gordon.
 Detective.
 I will find the man who did this.
 Pepper was framed by Fish Mooney and the cops.
 James Gordon is not a good guy.
 You deserve better.
 Don't ever come back to Gotham.
 I spoke with Cobblepot before he died.
 Men who are about to die are very honest.
 I am gonna kill that old man.
 I just wish Penguin was still alive.
 I've been watching you.
 I saw who really killed the Waynes.
 Excuse me! Unh.
 Hey, yo! Come on! Come on, move your car! - Thank you.
 - Hey, somebody took--! Stop him! You need something? Home.
 Let's go live for some breaking news.
 I'm coming to you with the latest wrinkle in a story that sent shockwaves through the financial world of Gotham.
 I'm standing before the home of Ronald Danzer the man who bilked investors out of a reported half billion dollars in a vast Ponzi scheme.
 Danzer is currently out on bail awaiting trial.
 All of them.
 The judge, the jury, the DA.
 Pay them whatever it takes.
 I am not going to prison just because a few dumb bus drivers and stupid old ladies lost their damn pensions.
 Ugh.
 I gotta sneak out.
 Villagers are here with pitchforks.
 You're my lawyer.
 Fix this.
 Balloons.
 Balloons? Air balloons.
 - Want a balloon? - What? No.
 No, thank you.
 No.
 Ronald Danzer? Who are you? Help me! That's Ronald Danzer.
 Roll the camera.
 Roll the camera! Help me! In a bizarre turn of events, a man appearing to be Ronald Danzer is rising into the air above Gotham attached to a weather balloon.
 The cart was loaded with bricks for ballast.
 Ronald Danzer cheats half of Gotham out of their savings but before he can stand in trial, a man clips him to a balloon? No body? - We're calling this a murder? - Call it a public service.
 Danzer was a bum.
 He got what he deserved.
 I'm gonna go get a Danish.
 It's what I deserve.
 Damn it! Somebody find me O'Brian.
 - Get me some ice.
 - Yes, sir, lieutenant.
 Who the hell are you? Jim Gordon.
 Jim Gordon.
 Bullock's new partner, right? Yeah.
 Lieutenant Bill Cranston.
 Bullock tells me you're a real boy scout.
 Don't think we should be roughing up the skells? They do have their rights.
 We'll have to remember that.
 Maybe I'll get that tattooed on my ass.
 Let me show you something, Gordon.
 This was a gift from the Gotham Chamber of Commerce for years of service.
 I call him O'Brian.
 He also just happens to be the best interrogator on the force.
 Nice meeting you, Gordon.
 Oh, Luke! Say hello to Sergeant O'Brian.
 No.
 No.
 I just met Lieutenant Cranston.
 - The man, the myth, the legend.
 - He's a thug.
 So no fingerprints.
 Those carts are too easy to buy or steal to trace.
 - How you coming on the death threats? - I thought we talked about this.
 Danzer was murdered.
 It's our job to catch murderers.
 - Guy was a crook.
 - Who had not been convicted of any crime.
 Tell that to the guys who killed themselves because he lost their savings.
 This guy was living high while the city kissed his ass and gave him awards for being a philanthropist.
 - So we let his killer go free? - Guy walks in here, holds out his hands Iâll arrest him.
 Otherwise, I'm content justice was served.
 - Like with the Waynes? That what you mean? - Mario Pepper killed the Waynes.
 We killed Pepper.
 That case is closed.
 Detective Gordon? Davis Lamond from Juvenile Services, you asked to see Selina Kyle.
 Sign for custody.
 When you finish, bring her to our facility on Water Street.
 She's scheduled to be transferred upstate tomorrow.
 Yeah, that's gonna be delayed.
 She has information about an investigation.
 Would you mind stepping back a bit, please? Wait a minute.
 Is that one of the kids that was snatched? Another closed case.
 What is it about the word closed you don't understand? This is something else.
 Just read the letters, track the balloons.
 I'll be back in an hour.
 Yeah, boss.
 Get right on it.
 Where's my pen? So why do you care who really killed the Waynes? Because I wanna see the person responsible brought to justice.
 Did you read that in a book or something? And I made a promise to the boy.
 So? The killer came from there.
 Took the man's wallet and the woman's necklace then shot them both.
 He left the boy alive.
 I was up there.
 Everybody knows that much.
 Plus, the killer's face was covered.
 Not at first.
 He pulled up his scarf when he walked toward them.
 - I saw him for a second.
 - You saw him? Here? In the dark? I can see in the dark.
 You don't believe me? There's the question of whether you're lying and whether you were even here.
 You're not giving me proof.
 I told you, I stole some chump's wallet before it happened.
 That was two blocks from here.
 Didn't he report it? Yes, a man did report his wallet stolen by a thief that matches your description.
 Yes, the timing does work out to just before the Waynes' murder.
 - But that does not place you here.
 - I dumped the wallet.
 There.
 A sewer.
 Great.
 It's not that I don't trust you not to run away, but, well I don't.
 You find the wallet, you let me go? That's the deal? No.
 I find the wallet, that places you here.
 - I still have to find the guy.
 - That's bull.
 That's the deal.
 Great.
 Son of a bitch.
 She was telling the truth.
 Oh, detective.
 You're gonna need these.
 Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Lazlo, honey take a rest.
 Poor thing.
 Well, well, well.
 Detectives Montoya and Allen.
 To what do I owe this honor? Thought we'd pay our respects.
 Maybe ask if you've seen your friend Cobblepot around.
 Oswald.
 Hmm.
 Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him.
 Isn't that funny? Almost as funny as two detectives from Major Crimes looking for a nobody like Oswald.
 Can we stop the dance? He's dead.
 Isn't he? Killed because he told us about Pepper being framed for the Wayne murders.
 He's dead.
 But I didn't kill the little Snitch.
 Word is Jim Gordon pulled the trigger.
 You have proof? What do I look like? A cop? I only heard that James Gordon splattered poor Oswald's brains all over Gotham River.
 Why would Gordon wanna murder Cobblepot? Just to keep him quiet about the frame? Wrong question, gorgeous.
 Jim Gordon pulled the trigger, but who gave the order? Who can make a cop commit cold-blooded murder? Falcone.
 Your deductive powers astonish me.
 Honestly, I just got a chill.
 There's a rumor going around that Falcone gave your latest boy-toy a nasty beating.
 You wouldn't be looking for revenge, would you? I just want justice for little Oswald.
 Hey, Cobblepot.
 You're supposed to be dead.
 I'm afraid you have me confused.
 My name is Dimitri.
 No, I heard you got whacked for ratting.
 Fish is gonna pay some serious cash for your skinny ass.
 No.
 Please.
 Please, she'll kill me! Why'd you even come back, huh? I could not stay away.
 Gotham is my home.
 It's my destiny.
 You don't see what's coming.
 I do.
 Gotham needs me.
 I'm its future.
 If you're its future, then Gotham is in trouble.
 Yes.
 Yes, it is.
 Can I have a tuna sandwich, please? - Alfred, I don't wanna do this.
 - What? - Stop, I don't wanna do this.
 - Come on, swat.
 En garde.
 Here we go, son.
 - What? What? Shall we go? - I don't want to do this.
 What? There she blows.
 Eye of the tiger through the wind in your nostrils, Sir Bruce.
 The blood in his veins.
 Sink.
 Mind your head.
 Dive! Oh, I do beg your pardon, sir, I-- That's gotta hurt.
 No, not really.
 I said, stop! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop.
 Down swords.
 I surrender.
 See? A nice swordfight gets our blood up, doesn't it? Better than reading these dusty old files.
 What is this, anyway? Police file.
 Your mom and dad.
 How did you get these? It wasn't hard.
 Why would you wanna look at these? They're horrible.
 They're gonna give you nightmares.
 I have those anyway and I'm looking for clues.
 So you're a detective now? - If I find a clue, I am.
 - Have you found a clue? - Not yet.
 - Not yet.
 Detective Gordon has promised you that he will find the person that killed-- - You really believe he will? He will try.
 Of that I'm certain.
 Yeah, Detective James Gordon.
 One of your counselors brought me a girl this morning and I signed for custody.
 That's what I'm saying, I can't bring her back, she got away.
 Yeah? Well, I'm not happy about it, either.
 On edge, Gordon? I'm fine.
 How can I help you? We were just, uh, wondering when you shot Cobblepot in the head and dumped his body in the river did Falcone pay? Or was that more of a favor to the don type thing? Whatever you heard, it's not true.
 Oh, so you mean you didn't kill Cobblepot? Or you didn't do it for Falcone? We thought we'd give you a chance to tell us the truth.
 Cop to cop.
 You're not listening.
 I didn't kill him.
 Okay, so where were you on the night of September the 17th? Are you really asking me this? Since when did Major Crimes become IA? When cops started doing hits for the mob.
 Yeah? Then come back to me when you have actual proof.
 Until then, don't waste my time.
 Hey, Gordon, piece of advice.
 Take a shower.
 Because you stink like a sewer.
 - Any job at all, even dishwasher.
 - We're staffed up.
 I only ask a chance to prove myself.
 - You ever work in a restaurant? - Not exactly.
 Here, you're on your feet all day.
 You don't even have the right shoes.
 There you are.
 We got the owner of a balloon factory downstairs.
 - Says he's got something for us.
 - Montoya and Allen came by.
 - They accused me of killing Cobblepot.
 - Damn.
 - Somebody must've talked.
 - Doesn't matter.
 The fact they're here means they got nothing and they're gonna get nothing.
 End of the day, no one cares about Cobblepot.
 - Because he deserved it? Like Danzer? - Don't make this into something bigger.
 You did what you had to do, and he did deserve it, he worked for Fish.
 She doesn't employ altar boys.
 What about Mario Pepper? He deserve what he got? Hell, yes.
 He was a dirtbag for trying to shoot you.
 Remember? I thought we were done talking about this.
 We're done talking about this when the person who actually murdered Thomas and Martha Wayne is in jail.
 Not the person we killed for it.
 For the last time, Gordon let it go.
 - Or what? Am I gonna be the next person taken out to the pier to get a bullet in the head? The interview's waiting.
 Pardon me.
 You work at that Italian restaurant, don't you? Yeah.
 And what size are your shoes? Uh, nines.
 What a coincidence! When I saw that balloon go up on TV, I knew it was mine.
 I said to myself, Jimmy boy, you better call the cops right away.
 Or they'll try and pin this on you.
 So it was you who called us? I thought my partner had gone to the trouble of tracking you down.
 How exactly was your balloon used to kill Ronald Danzer? It was stolen by my bum of an ex-employee a month ago.
 Carl Smikers.
 That's what I get for hiring a kid.
 - Did he ever mention Danzer? - Hell, no.
 I'm surprised if he even knew who Danzer was.
 We ain't talking about one of those intellectually superior types here.
 - You got an address? - Yeah, you find him see you can get back the others.
 - The other what? The other balloons.
 A grand a pop those things are.
 He stole four.
 Forty-seven dollars? Frankie, I'm coming back next week, try to show some initiative, all right? Okay, Bill.
 You're a disgrace to drug dealers.
 - Hot dog? - Get lost.
 - Hot dog? - I said, get lost! Lieutenant Cranston? All right.
 Let's see.
 Let's see what we got here.
 What the hell? Who are you? Oh, no.
 Right.
 So no breakfast then.
 And no dinner last night.
 What's the new program? You wanna see how long we can go without eating anything? Well, if that's the case, I should save myself the trouble of making it.
 Have you seen this? Oh, yeah, nuts are going around offing people with balloons.
 Can think of easier ways to kill someone.
 Master Bruce, forgive me for uttering the tired old words in times like these.
 But in times like these you really need to keep your strength up.
 I'm just not hungry.
 Morning.
 Hi.
 Thank you.
 - I tried not to wake you.
 - It's fine.
 I have a meeting.
 You Okay? You hardly slept last night.
 - It's just work.
 - This Balloonman thing? That's what the paper's calling him.
 And it says he killed a cop.
 You're not in danger, are you? You don't have to worry about me.
 Well, what is it then? I can see somethings bothering you.
 Yesterday our first victim, Ronald Danzer he was a con man.
 Nobody cared.
 Now that a cop's been targeted the investigation will get all the support it needs.
 It's not right.
 Everyone has to matter or nobody matters.
 Otherwise people lose faith and that's when you get vigilantes.
 But that isn't your fault.
 I mean, if anything, you're giving people faith.
 Am I? How? Your first case, you caught the Wayne killer.
 Do you have any idea what that meant for the city? You're a hero.
 I gotta go.
 Don't matter if you a cop, you dirty, The Balloonman gonna get you.
 It's time the people of Gotham realize that they have to stand up for themselves.
 Hey, Balloonman ought to get to my landlord next.
 He's a crook.
 And his name is Harold-- This is wonderful.
 This is like my dream of how today was gonna go.
 Besides the black eye to the department, now we have a vigilante who kills bad cops.
 - Cranston wasn't that bad.
 - But whatever he was or wasn't guilty of Cranston was a lieutenant in the G.
C.
P.
D.
 You don't get to go around killing cops.
 Where are you on this in the Danzer murder? We're looking for a man named Carl Smikers.
 He was an employee at the factory where the balloons were stolen.
 We have uniforms staking out his apartment, but he hasn't been back there.
 - And you like him for this? - Oh, he's guilty.
 Leave me in a room with him, he'll be guilty.
 He's connected, but I'm not sure he's the one.
 He had weather balloons.
 Cranston and Danzer were killed with weather balloons.
 He's the guy.
 Smikers never graduated high school.
 He's never held a job for more than a year.
 He's got busts for soliciting.
 Possession.
 - Tell her about the other balloons.
 - What other balloons? Smikers' boss mentioned that four balloons are missing.
 There are two of them still out there.
 So two more targets? We have any sense who they might be? Danzer and Cranston were both known figures, and known to be dirty.
 Killer didn't need any special knowledge to target them.
 So it's likely the next target is public and known to be corrupt.
 Basically every elected official in Gotham should stay indoors.
 Find him.
 - Now.
 - We will.
 We Will? What happened to the killer doing the city a favor? You're gonna make me think you actually care.
 You wanna kill a crook-financier, be my guest.
 You kill a cop, it's a job safety issue.
 We need a plan.
 Relax, one thing I do know is how to find someone.
 Beautiful, baby.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Yo.
 What did he tell you? Nothing.
 I was just hungry.
 Mm.
 Mm.
 You wash dishes, mop the floor, take out the trash.
 Otherwise you're deaf, dumb and blind.
 - I understand-- - No.
 You don't.
 But you will.
 This ain't like other places, and you'll either get it Or I'll be fired? You could say that.
 Oh, you have nothing to worry about.
 I know that this is a great opportunity-- Don Maroni.
 Good to see you.
 Great opportunity indeed.
 Our suspect had a prior for soliciting two years ago, right? One of my girls said he looked familiar, remembered he liked big, brawny types.
 She pointed me to that pimp, that guy who specialized in that.
 - He remembered - After you roughed him up a little.
 that he used to do deliveries for this, uh, dry cleaner, Mr.
 Chang he remembered the guy was a mahjong nut.
 He was into these Chinese bookies for five grand.
 And they sent you here? By way of bike messengers, a guy that runs some pickpockets on the south side and a pot sticker joint the guy apparently loves.
 Dragon Palace.
 - We didn't order any-- - Carl Smikers? Run! G.
C.
P.
D! You're under arrest! Don't move! Don't move.
 Jim, a little help! Put it down! Put it down now! You put the MCU on to that cop killing Oswald.
 Falcone finds out it came from you, I-- I mean I don't mind what he did to me.
 It's, uh-- Lazlo, honey you're worried about me, aren't you? But you must remember it wasn't you Falcone wanted to hurt it was me.
 Understand? Good.
 The boy has lost his spine.
 Not everyone is built for a beating like that.
 What's that new piece that the Roman has been seeing? What's her name? Natalia? Nadia? - Mm-hm.
 - Yeah.
 Tell Butch she's going to have an accident.
 Such a shame.
 She was a pretty girl.
 And get rid of Lazlo while you're at it.
 He's bringing down the mood.
 With pleasure.
 - My God.
 - Sorry.
 - I knocked but I could hear someone-- - How did you get in? - I still have a key, remember? - And you just let yourself in? Give it to me.
 I could have you arrested.
 Or I could arrest you.
 Anyway, it's kind of early to get high, isn't it? It's been a stressful day.
 - Is that all you're doing? - I'm afraid so.
 Disappointed? Don't play with me, Barbara.
 I was there, remember? - Through all of it.
 - You mean you're part of it? Fine.
 - Answer the question.
 - Yes.
 This is it.
 Now that you've broken into my home and accused me of being a drug addict, you can leave.
 Not until we talk about Gordon.
 - He's killed a man.
 - You told me.
 It's not true.
 Not Mario Pepper.
 Another man.
 And he killed him on the orders of Carmine Falcone biggest crime boss in Gotham.
 You're lying.
 But you know, I guess I should be used to that.
 True.
 When we were together, I did lie to you.
 A lot.
 But you always knew.
 You looked in my eyes and you knew when I was lying to you.
 Am I lying now? Is this just because I love him? Is that why you are so determined to destroy him? I've been sober for a year and I know that doesn't erase the things that I did but I still care about you.
 I can't stand you being with this man.
 You deserve better.
 Leave.
 Now.
 Ask him where he was the night that Oswald Cobblepot disappeared.
 That's the name of the man he killed.
 I'm telling the truth.
 I didn't kill those guys.
 I mean, a cop? Why would I kill a cop? Maybe because you're a thieving, cop-murdering pile of crap.
 But mind you, that's just a theory.
 - You admit stealing the balloons? - Yeah, but I owed these loan sharks.
 And if I didn't pay them, they were gonna cut off stuff.
 If you didn't kill Danzer and Cranston, who did? - Who did you sell the balloons to? - I never saw his face.
 We had a drop off point to exchange the balloons and money.
 You know what we got here, Jim? We got us a criminal mastermind.
 Not only is the murder weapon in the stratosphere but so are the bodies.
 It's the perfect crime.
 The bodies will come back.
 What are you talking about? You guys not know how weather balloons work? Tell us, genius.
 Or I'll beat it out of you.
 Wait-- Okay, they rise up and it gets colder and colder, and the balloon gets brittle and the helium expands.
 Then what? It pops.
 I'm really starting to dislike this case.
 Where do you think they find shovels that big, huh? We only have to worry about one more balloon.
 - Who? - Quinn.
 He's meditating in his garden.
 Alvarez is on his way to the scene.
 We're gonna have the church on our back.
 Great.
 Forget the fact that Quinn was known as the diddling priest.
 Here's what we found in Cranston's pockets.
 What wasn't smashed to bits.
 Why is your name on this, Jim? I know who the Balloonman is.
 You see, Falcone is only the boss of Gotham because people believe he's the boss.
 That's what this Arkham thing is gonna change.
 People are gonna see that the emperor's got no clothes.
 I'm wasting my breath.
 You're an idiot.
 Get out of here.
 Who the hell are you? I-- I'm sorry, sir.
 I am-- Hold on.
 Put that down.
 You were listening, huh? You're new.
 What's your name? Paolo, sir.
 Italian? You don't look Italian.
 On my mother's side.
 It's the side that I claim.
 A boy who loves his mother.
 Here.
 Take it.
 I was a lot like you.
 Started from nothing.
 But I kept my head down, I worked hard, now look at me.
 Gotham is the city of opportunity.
 Yes, sir.
 I believe that too.
 You hear what I was saying back there? Those names? Falcone.
 Arkham.
 They mean anything to you? Honestly, sir, I didn't hear anything at all.
 Attaboy.
 The Balloonman has struck once again.
 Cardinal Quinn, accused of multiple accounts of sexual abuse is the latest victim of the vigilante.
 See this? This is not good.
 You can't go around killing priests.
 At least not in public.
 Go take care of your mother, Paolo.
 His name is Davis Lamond, 48.
 He's worked at Juvenile Services for 15 years.
 No priors.
 He didn't show up at work today.
 And he hasn't been back to his apartment.
 - We have uniforms in both.
 - You're positive he's the killer? We found a form on Cranston's body that I've given Lamond yesterday morning.
 Also, keys that opened Lamond's apartment.
 I'm guessing they had a scuffle.
 Cranston went through his pockets but Lamond managed to attach him to the balloon.
 What caused Lamond to snap? Not sure.
 Lamond's coworkers describe him as thoughtful, dedicated, sweet.
 A few said that.
 Great, one of those sweet cop-killing vigilantes.
 - What about his last target? - Same profile as all the rest.
 Well-known.
 Seemingly respectable.
 Actually corrupt.
 This is Gotham.
 That doesn't exactly narrow it down.
 Meanwhile, I have the mayor, city council half the city's judges and clergy hiding indoors screaming at the commissioner to find the guy.
 Guess who he screams at? We've got his photo out there.
 It's just a matter of time.
 - Nothing.
 - Really? Your network of Chinese loan sharks and hookers came up empty? Gloat later.
 Just think about it.
 He had to store the balloons, the helium canisters, the carts he was using Maybe a storage facility, a warehouse? Or an abandoned building.
 That's it? How'd you come up with that? It's the same thing I just said.
 What made you figure this place? The girl yesterday, Selina, she told me she was in a new juvie building.
 Lamond, the counselor, said the same thing.
 What happened to the old juvie building? Turns out, the city's getting ready to demo it.
 Even if he was here, he's probably long gone.
 He's only got one balloon left.
 He knows we're closing in Or that's him right there.
 Bullock! Drop the gun now! - I can't do that, detective, I'm not done yet.
 - One more time, drop it.
 - You should be helping me.
 - You're wasting your breath.
 My partner thinks you're as bad as the scum you kill.
 Me, I can see how you're doing us a favor, so don't shoot me, all right? You believe as I do.
 You're the one who caught those child snatchers.
 - You risked your life.
 - So did I.
 You wanna protect the innocent? Yes, we have laws for that.
 And what good are laws when they require men like your Lieutenant Cranston to implement them? And Ronald Danzer? You think he would have seen the inside of a jail? Or that priest? Why didn't the law punish him? I have given my life to the lost children of Gotham because I wanted to make a difference.
 You know what kind of difference I made? None.
 Because the people running this city feed off the weak, and the law protects them.
 When your mayor rounded up all those children to send off to that prison upstate I decided no more.
 I would teach them there are consequences.
 So why don't you ask yourself, detective.
 Who are you fighting for? A mayor in the mob's pocket, cops on the take or for the weak and the innocent? Who are you finally? Forget it.
 No, no! Aah! - What are you doing? - How do you like that? - Grab him! - How does it feel you're hoisted by your own petard? No, Jim! Jim, what are you doing? Jim, let go! - Shoot it! Shoot the balloon! - Jim! - Let go! - Shoot it! Just let go! Shoot it now! Carmine.
 What a lovely surprise.
 We're not quite open.
 But for you Hello, Fish.
 Just stopped by on my way to dinner.
 I wanted to make sure there were no hard feelings.
 Never.
 That's my girl.
 Speaking of your girl, that'd better be the reason why you're ditching me tonight.
 What's her name again? Nadia? Natalia.
 And no.
 She had an accident.
 I hope nothing serious.
 A mugging.
 Mugging? Ever since the Waynes were killed, the city has gone crazy.
 I hope the punk who did it paid with his life.
 He will, when we find him.
 Along with anyone who helped him.
 Are you hearing any rumblings from Maroni's camp? You don't actually believe that Maroni had something to do with it, do you? Like you say people are acting crazy and crazy is bad for business.
 Especially with everything on the horizon.
 You're talking about Arkham.
 I thought you had that locked up.
 Keep your eyes open.
 Hold on.
 Give me a second.
 There will be more like me, detective.
 You know that, don't you? Not if we do our job.
 And We Will.
 I Will.
 You had your chance.
 All of you.
 Who was your last target? The crusade of the vigilante known as The Balloonman ended when he was apprehended by police.
 He was the man who stood up to the corruption eating at the heart of Gotham willing to break the law in order to save it.
 I'd imagine the criminals of Gotham are sleeping well tonight.
 He killed people.
 That made him a criminal too.
 That's very true.
 Can I get you anything else? No, thank you, Alfred.
 Right, well, you know Do try and eat a bit, won't you? Be a shame to have you floating away.
 G.
C.
P.
D.
 claims a win, but this journalist is left to wonder now that The Balloonman is gone, who will defend the people of Gotham? This is Channel 7 at 7 reporting live from the former Gotham Juvenile Facility Center in downtown with your minute-to-minute update.
 Back to the newsroom, John.
 You're okay.
 Are you okay? Yeah.
 I fell, that's all.
 I'm fine.
 What's wrong? I want you to know that you can tell me anything.
 The city is sick.
 Sick in a way I hadn't realized.
 When they were taking him away, this Balloonman killer I asked who his last target was.
 You know what he said? Doesn't matter.
 He meant the mayor, judges, anyone in a position of power they're all guilty.
 But that's not true.
 That's how he feels.
 That's how they all feel.
 Everyone.
 That's why the city embraced him.
 Because we let them down.
 But if people take the law into their own hands then there is no law.
 And we're lost.
 There are cops who do it.
 Same thing he did.
 But you never would.
 Do you think I could? No.
 I know you Jim Gordon.
 And I love you.
 And now I'm gonna get you a drink.
 I'll get it.
 Jim? Hello, James old friend.
   

                



                


                    			There's a war coming, a terrible war.
 There will be chaos.
 Rivers of blood in the streets.
 I know it.
 I can see it coming.
 It's time.
 Somebody has to take over, it might as well be me.
 - My name's James Gordon.
 I'm a detective.
 - My name's Bruce Wayne.
 I promise I will find the man who did this.
 Stop or I'll shoot! He was framed to cover up for the real killer.
 Don't ever come back to Gotham.
 He's killed a man on the orders of Carmine Falcone biggest crime boss in Gotham.
 The death of the Waynes would bring troubled times for our family and Gotham.
 The Maroni family senses weakness.
 Jim, it's for you.
 Jim.
 Hello, James.
 Old friend.
 - You must be Barbara.
 - Yes, please come in.
 James, hi.
 I'm Peter.
 Peter Humboldt.
 Heh.
 Lovely to meet you at last.
 You're even more beautiful than I imagined.
 Shush.
 Nice to meet you, Peter.
 I never meet Jim's friends.
 He never tells me anything.
 - Men.
 - Don't I know.
 - Would you like a drink? - No.
 Uh He's a work friend.
 It's a work thing.
 I'm just recently back in Gotham and I had an idea to pop by.
 Out of the blue.
 But now is clearly not a good time.
 I'll walk you out.
 I told you never to come back here.
 I know.
 I know, I-- I apologize.
 But I just wanted to speak with you.
 No.
 If Falcone finds out you're alive, he'll kill us both.
 I got no place else to go.
 Gotham is my home.
 I should have killed you.
 I should put a bullet in your head right now.
 And you would have every right to do so.
 But you won't, Jim Gordon.
 You're a good man.
 You may very well be the last good man in Gotham.
 That's why I want to help you.
 - I don't want your help.
 - No, no, but you need it.
 That vile creature Fish Mooney Don Falcone, the police.
 Not even your own partner trusts you.
 They will always hide the truth from you.
 But not me.
 Never.
 - You saved my life.
 - God knows I wish I hadn't.
 Kill me now.
 Or trust me.
 I told you there's a war coming, Jim.
 There will be so many deaths.
 So many.
 You wanna save Gotham? I can help you.
 I can be your secret agent.
 Until Falcone finds out you're alive.
 Nobody looks for a dead man.
 Hm? This war, what are you talking about? Why will there be a war? Uh, as you know, war is just politics by other means.
 And isn't politics just money? Talking? Talking about what? Arkham, of course.
 - Ready for some prime rib tonight? - I am, sir.
 Excuse me.
 Councilman Jenkins? - Can I help you? - Yes, uh, I'm one of your constituents.
 Voted for you every time.
 Thank you very much, my friend.
 I don't want to take up too much of your time.
 I just want to show you something.
 I'm always happy to help constituents, but perhaps you can come by my office.
 Sir, please.
 Just one second.
 Now, I got the idea for this years ago.
 Designed and built it myself.
 Here.
 Take a look Go ahead.
 You just put your eye on the end there.
 That's it.
 - What is that thing? - You'll see.
 No, no, no.
 You're next.
 Honestly, sir, I really did vote for you.
 Hey, I'm working.
 Caught a double homicide.
 You're up.
 No way.
 Alvarez hasn't done a case all week.
 It's his turn.
 Alvarez put in double overtime last week.
 Hey, Gordon.
 Captain.
 Councilman Ron Jenkins and his aide were found dead in a parking structure this morning.
 Still waiting on the ME's report.
 Their wallets and jewelry were missing.
 Councilman? Maybe it's a political hit.
 No one hits councilmen.
 It's cheaper to bribe them.
 You kill them and another bum with his hand out takes his place.
 Sniff around City Hall if you want.
 Smart money says this is wrong place, wrong time.
 - Go work it.
 - Ugh.
 Slave driver.
 Don't worry, Jim.
 I know just where to start.
 O, at sea again And now my hurricanes Have brought down this ocean rain - She's got talent.
 - Hm.
 - She's not bad-looking.
 - That's plenty.
 Come to me so I can take you in.
 You sing well.
 For this job I need more than a pair of nice pipes and a pretty face.
 I'll do whatever it takes.
 I like hearing that.
 So you like boys or girls? Boys.
 Fine.
 Pretend I'm a boy.
 Seduce me.
 At least you can sing.
 Butch, put a pin in this one.
 We'll call you.
 Not bad, but keep looking.
 Really, boss? That's a good-looking girl.
 Look at me.
 I ain't looking for no girl.
 I'm looking for a weapon.
 Come on, Nicky, don't be modest.
 You're the crown prince of parking lot muggers.
 No one's got a bigger rep.
 I'm on sabbatical.
 I didn't kill no one.
 That's not my thing.
 - Then Why'd you have a shank in your bag? - Protection.
 Councilman Jenkins was murdered.
 - We know it was you.
 We got witnesses.
 - I swear to God, I didn't do it.
 Hey.
 - Hey! - He's not our guy, Harvey.
 - Alvarez, what's this? - Yo.
 Evidence from your crime scene.
 A couple unis just dropped it off.
 Arkham? Forty acres.
 Twenty-six city blocks.
 The last major undeveloped district in the city of Gotham.
 Arkham.
 Now, before their untimely and tragic deaths Thomas and Martha Wayne had a plan for their city.
 A progressive development plan that would raze Arkham's shanty towns, and in its place build new, affordable housing for Gotham's less fortunate.
 - What about the old asylum, mayor? - Torn down.
 Brick by brick if need be.
 In its place, a cutting edge state-of-the-art mental health facility.
 This is a vision for the future of our city.
 An opposing plan is gaining support recently.
 Then it would do away with the asylum all together.
 Use the surrounding land as a waste disposal site.
 No.
 No, the Wayne plan is best for this city and more importantly, for the people of this city.
 This is why I am endorsing it.
 Don Maroni.
 - Heh.
 Pleasure to see you.
 - Thank you.
 How are you? Please, please, have a seat.
 I'll bring wine and bread.
 Today is a day of celebration.
 A very lucrative deal is coming my way.
 Land, my friend.
 Land.
 That's where the big money is.
 Huh? I need information about the Wayne plan for Arkham.
 Ah, it's the Wayne plan in name only now.
 When the Waynes died, Falcone stepped in.
 He's back in the plan now.
 And he stands to make quite a chunk of change if it passes.
 But Councilman Jenkins was backing Falcone's plan.
 That's right.
 - Then he was killed because? - Because, detective there is an opposing plan.
 Maroni.
 He's the only one strong enough to oppose Falcone.
 He's making a play at Arkham.
 Are they related? Bruce.
 How are you? The new Arkham Asylum will serve the mentally ill of Gotham in ways the present asylum never can.
 Those poor, sick souls deserve our help.
 My mother wrote that.
 She and my father fought for years to get a new asylum built.
 They thought that if they can help the city's least fortunate it would show there was hope for everyone.
 I just don't want my parents' dream to die with them.
 I understand that, Bruce.
 But this isn't just about the asylum.
 If there is a fight between Falcone and Maroni this could be the spark that ignites a city-wide gang war.
 Innocents will die.
 And whatever little faith people have that police can protect them It will be crushed.
 So you have to stop it.
 - This is Gordon.
 - Hey, it's me.
 We got a call.
 Councilman Zeller's been abducted.
 Listen, Gordon, Zeller's one of Maroni's guys.
 Be right there.
 Please, don't.
 I'm begging you.
 Stop.
 You know if it were up to me, this would be over quick without all the fuss.
 My father used to say, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
 But it's not up to me.
 My customer specifically asked me to send a message.
 And you know what they say.
 The customer is always right.
 Please.
 You don't have to do this.
 Help, somebody! No, wait! Tell Falcone I'll change my vote.
 I'll back the mayor! I'll do anything he wants! Please, please! Please, help.
 Please! Plea-- Two councilmen dead in as many days.
 Can't be a coincidence.
 Gotta be politics driving this.
 He was right.
 Never said he was wrong.
 I just wanted him to be.
 All right, genius.
 Any other insights? Yeah, this is about the Arkham vote.
 - How so? - Arkham is more than just a land deal.
 It's a war between Falcone and Maroni.
 These councilmen were on opposite sides.
 So who did who? The way I see it, Maroni struck first.
 He had Jenkins killed to change the vote his way.
 Then Falcone retaliated.
 Had Zeller killed to change the vote back.
 Burning the body was Falcone's message.
 I'll have guards put on other councilmen and the mayor until this plays out.
 So you wanna tell me? Come on.
 Falcone, Maroni, Arkham.
 How the hell do you know so much all of a sudden? - Ed, what you got? - I have a paradox for you.
 - What? - Well, a paradox, detective, is when you-- I know what a paradox is, smart-ass.
 What paradox? These are the medical examiner's reports on the murders of Councilman Jenkins and his aide.
 Both victims sustained fatal puncture wounds to the skull via the eye socket.
 The weapon was some kind of metal spike.
 - Okay, so? - Councilman Zeller also has wounds from a metal spike.
 It's an extremely unlikely coincidence, don't you think? You're saying Zeller, Jenkins and the aide were killed by the same person? It would appear so, wouldn't it? Same killer working for both Maroni and Falcone? - That's nuts.
 - Heh-heh.
 Only in Gotham.
 Come on.
 - Where we going? - Go see a friend of mine.
 - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Uh, uh, uh-- You were snooping, you little worm.
 I told you when I gave you the job that in here, you don't see nothing, you don't hear nothing.
 I'm sorry, sir.
 I beg your pardon.
 You keep that sniveling nose of yours to yourself, understood? Yes, sir.
 Two cartons.
 Must be important.
 - We're looking for a hit man.
 - Yeah? Which family's he work for? A few.
 He's an independent type, like you.
 Not too many of them still around.
 - Who'd they hit? - Two city councilmen and an aide.
 He uses a special weapon to kill.
 A steel spike? About so big? Could be.
 - You know him? - I heard of him.
 His name is Gladwell.
 A real pro.
 - You know where we can find him? - Word was he works out of the Lansky building in Midtown.
 Coming or what? We got 12 more floors to check.
 What's got you so wound up? Maybe I'm just doing my job.
 You've been acting weird lately, like you got something to hide.
 G.
C.
P.
D.
, ma'am.
 We're looking for someone who may work here.
 - Last name Gladwell.
 - Oh, you mean Richard.
 He works in Human Resources.
 - Richard's not in any trouble, is he? - Which desk is his? Third one from the back.
 Gladwell.
 Richard Gladwell.
 Has anyone seen him? - You just missed him.
 - Where'd he go? He was just here.
 Maybe he headed out the back? I'll go check it out.
 Stay here in case he comes back? Jim, I found something.
 Look what was in his desk.
 Jenkins and Zeller.
 We got him.
 Man, I love the easy ones.
 - Freeze.
 - Ah! It's just a box of paper clips.
 I didn't think anyone would mind.
 - Sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 You okay? - Ah! CLM? What do you think it means? I don't know.
 You all right? I'm fine.
 Ahem.
 - Why? - Well I heard screaming.
 Bad dream.
 Oh.
 Was I in it? Not this time.
 - There any more files on the Arkham plan? - Yeah.
 Absolutely untold piles of the bloody things.
 I'd like to see them, please.
 All of them.
 And may I ask why? I'm looking for a connection.
 Between the councilmen murders and the murders of my parents.
 I see.
 Nobody move.
 This is a robbery.
 Money's in the back.
 Go, go! What do you think you're doing? Get over there.
 Let's go.
 Move! Move! Move.
 Out of my way.
 Out of my way.
 Check the back.
 They got the money, Frankie.
 I got eyes, don't I? Ah! Oh! Oh.
 Oh, thank goodness you're here.
 They had guns, and Lou-- Lou was hit in the stomach.
 ls he--? Forget about Lou.
 Who did this? Uh, they had masks.
 I couldn't see.
 - But you got the money.
 - Oh, yeah.
 I managed to hide this bag, but they got the rest.
 - I'm sorry, I-- - Hey, relax, kid.
 Save it for the boss.
 You're off early for a change.
 Missed you.
 You all right? Long hours and late nights, Jim.
 They make me worry.
 - About what? - All kinds of things.
 - Just doing my job.
 - Are you? What is that supposed to mean? It means I think you have secrets from me.
 And I hate it.
 What do you want me to say, Barbara? Yeah, I have secrets.
 - It's part of my job.
 It's how-- - Who's Oswald Cobblepot? - How do you know that name? - Doesn't matter.
 Who is he? - I can't even begin to answer that.
 - Can't or won't? Montoya.
 She came to see you, didn't she? Yes.
 Why does she keep coming to you? What is it between you and her? Years ago, before I was with you she and I were in a relationship.
 What? It only lasted a year.
 And then I ended it and moved on.
 And what? She didn't? I don't know.
 I don't care, okay? Because you are the one that I want to spend the rest of my life with.
 - What? You're angry? - What do you think? - Because she's a woman? - Because you lied to me! Okay, I'm sorry.
 I should have told you.
 Falcone thinks he can hit me in my place of business and get away with it? He's got another thing coming, Frankie.
 I want to hit him back.
 This time where it hurts.
 I wanna hit the Mouth.
 His time's up.
 I'll take care of it.
 Then there's the other thing.
 Send him over.
 You know, I'm a man that shows appreciation when appreciation is due.
 Yes, Don Maroni.
 What you did for me yesterday did not go unnoticed.
 Thank you, sir.
 I only wish I was able to retrieve the other-- Ba-ba-ba.
 Ba.
 How long you been washing dishes? - Not long.
 - That ends today.
 You've been promoted to restaurant manager.
 The position recently became available.
 Thank you, Don Maroni.
 I won't let you down.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 You're welcome.
 Frankie, get the kid a suit.
 He's dead.
 - Who? - Richard Gladwell.
 At least, the real one.
 Sent some unis by his apartment, found a moldy old corpse sealed inside.
 Puncture wound through the eye.
 Been dead five years.
 - And no one found him until now? - Landlord said he paid rent on time.
 Kept quiet.
 The ideal tenant.
 So our hit man killed this Gladwell to use his identity as cover.
 And it worked too.
 Employee records, payroll, contact information, all fake.
 We got nothing but a face.
 Damn.
 All right, there's gotta be something to this.
 CLM.
 You got any ideas? It's a complete waste of time.
 It's a lead.
 Our only lead.
 - Says you.
 - You can't be this lazy.
 Lazy? Maybe I just work smarter than you.
 Ever consider that? Yeah.
 I considered it.
 This Arkham vote is tomorrow.
 If we don't find this guy by then What? What happens? Worst case? A major gang war.
 People will die.
 Maybe a lot of people.
 We find this guy, we can stop it.
 And where are you going? To work the case.
 You got your ways, I got mine.
 Hey, Harvey tell her I said hi.
 You hear laughter Cracking through the halls That sends you spinning You have no choice Following the footsteps Of a rag-doll dance We are entranced Spellbound What's your name? Liza.
 How long have you been singing, Liza? Not long.
 Do you like boys or girls? Boys.
 So you want the job or what? Well, you haven't told me what it is yet.
 You want to be a woman with power, money and respect like me? I guess.
 Yeah.
 Are you willing to do whatever it takes to have it all? Yes, I am.
 That's the job.
 Seduce me.
 Heh.
 What? You think I'm kidding.
 Harvey.
 You see something you like? I do now.
 I need your help.
 City councilmen are dropping like flies.
 - I heard.
 - Bad for business.
 - You're not wrong.
 - Button man's called Gladwell.
 Know him? - Only by reputation.
 - Think you can find him? I can find anyone if I have the time.
 The question is, what's in it for me? I'll owe you.
 Okay, but I still think it's a waste of time, if you ask me.
 Falcone will just get someone to take his place.
 - He's not gonna let this bone go.
 - Why's that? Falcone cannot afford to lose that vote.
 If Maroni gets even a piece of Arkham, it'll only prove what we already know.
 And that is, Falcone is old and weak.
 You seem kind of pleased about that.
 How come? Falcone goes down, so do you.
 Harvey, don't you worry about me.
 I always have a plan B.
 Detective Gordon.
 Hello, old friend.
 What do you want? To offer you help.
 To prove that you can trust me.
 There's gonna be another murder.
 - Maroni has put out the hit.
 - Who's the target? Someone backing Falcone's plan.
 Who it is, I can't be certain.
 All the councilmen are under police protection tonight.
 Heh.
 There are many ways around the police.
 But the hit will happen tonight.
 That much I can be certain.
 How do you know this? I told you, detective.
 Gotham is my home.
 I need a list of the officers working police protection tonight.
 Campos, Lazenby, Martins.
 CLM.
 Hey, it's Harvey.
 Bullock, I found out who Gladwell's next target is.
 It's the mayor.
 - Detective, what's going on? - I think you're in danger.
 - I need to get you out of here.
 - What? I'm not going anywhere.
 I got police protection.
 - They're gone.
 - What? I just checked.
 No one's out there.
 Sir, I think someone's coming here to kill you.
 I gotta get some things from my safe.
 Sir, we need to go.
 Now.
 - I'll move as fast as I can.
 - Is there someplace safe I can take you? - We're not going to the police station? - Not sure you'll be safe there.
 Police - What the hell's this town coming to? - Sir All right, all right.
 My sister's house.
 It's across town.
 Let's go.
 Go.
 Go.
 Go.
 - Is there another way out? - Here.
 He's trying to get in.
 - Shoot him.
 Why don't you shoot him? - He's got my gun, I can't.
 Go.
 Go.
 Go.
 Drop it! Drop it, or I'll shoot.
 You know why they hire a professional? Because he finishes the job.
 - How are you? - I'm okay.
 Jim, I should've told you about Montoya a long time ago.
 - And why didn't you? - I don't know.
 Because she works with you.
 Because she's a woman.
 Are you sure there isn't another reason? No.
 There's nothing else.
 Jim, I don't want there to be any secrets between us.
 - Neither do I.
 - Good.
 So you'll tell me who Oswald Cobblepot is.
 Damn it, Barbara.
 Why can't you drop this? - Why can't you just tell me who he is? - Because it's work.
 I know.
 But you told me about your work before.
 And that was a mistake.
 One I am not going to make again.
 All right, well I'm not gonna live like this.
 I can't live like this.
 You're gonna have to make a choice, Jim.
 You either let me in or you let me go.
 All right, I'm going to cut to the chase.
 I like you both, but I only have one opening.
 You've got the talent.
 And you've got something else.
 I can't decide.
 So you two are going to have to do it for me.
 You want us to fight for it? So when do I start? It's you.
 Heh.
 Scared us there for a second.
 We do good, or what? Excellent work, my friends.
 You were very convincing.
 Yeah, I bet that manager thought so, huh? Ain't that right, Dickie? Got any other joints you want us to rob, let us know.
 - There's good money in this.
 - Good money.
 What's that? Oh, I brought cannoli.
 Hell, yeah.
 Ha.
 Eat up.
 You guys deserve this.
 - Yeah.
 - Check this out.
 - Mmm.
 - It's really good.
 Real good.
 The Arkham development vote has been a topic of controversy for weeks.
 Today we have the results.
 We go live now to Mayor James's press conference.
 - Mind turning that down? Head's killing me.
 - Oh, shut up.
 This is what we worked for.
 We did this.
 How is today's outcome not simply a failure of the Wayne plan? This is not a case of either plan failing.
 This is a case of compromise for what's best for the people of Gotham.
 The Arkham district will be developed into both low-cost housing as well as a much needed site for waste disposal.
 This is the best of both plans.
 Together in one.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 For years, this city's been giving us nothing but scraps.
 But from now on From now on, we feast.
 - Yeah.
 - Yes.
 Mayor James, what about the asylum? What's going to happen to it? Arkham Asylum will be retrofitted to meet today's standards and reopened.
 Gotham needs-- No, Gotham deserves a world-class treatment facility for the mentally ill.
 Falcone took a shot to the body today.
 Maybe a few more will put him on his back.
 Looks like I got you just in time.
 And I know that the Waynes, were they still alive would be proud of what we've been able to accomplish today.
 The mayor's making this new plan sound like it's good for Gotham.
 - But it's not, is it? - No, it's not.
 Then why's he doing it? He was caught between two very powerful opposing forces.
 Falcone and Maroni.
 Maroni threatened the mayor's life.
 Out of fear, I'm guessing, the mayor made a compromise and gave Maroni a huge piece of Arkham.
 What piece? Maroni gets to build a waste disposal site.
 And he gets the contract to refurbish Arkham.
 Falcone gets to build a low-income housing project.
 Look, Bruce I know it's not the outcome you had hoped for.
 But this compromise it may have prevented a lot of bloodshed.
 May have even stopped a war.
 My parents believed a new asylum would bring hope to Gotham.
 Now that's gone.
 Everything they worked for is now falling into the hands of criminals.
 Not everything.
 You're alive.
 It's not too late.
 Do you really believe that? Do you believe Gotham can be saved? I believe it's worth trying.
   

                



                


                    			 There's a war coming.
 A terrible war.
 There will be chaos.
 Rivers of blood in the streets.
 I know it.
 I can see it coming.
 It's time.
 Somebody has to take over.
 It might as well be me.
 I'm looking for a connection between the Arkham plan and the murders of my parents.
 If Maroni gets even a piece of Arkham, it'll prove Falcone is weak.
 Don't ever come back to Gotham.
 Hello, James, old friend.
 - I told you never to come back! - Nobody looks for a dead man.
 So you want the job or what? Yes.
 I ain't looking for no girl.
 I'm looking for a weapon.
 Falcone thinks he can hit me in my place of business and get away with it? I wanna hit him back.
 Fancy a stroll? It's a lovely day.
 - Stretch the legs, breath of fresh air.
 - I'm busy.
 I got a question for you, Master Bruce.
 What if all of this was a complete and utter bloody waste of time? What if you never discovered who killed your mom and dad? Hmm? What if you never get to wreak revenge? I don't want revenge.
 I wanna understand how it all works.
 How Gotham works.
 Well, you'd have more chance digging to China with a teaspoon.
 Take the Arkham project, for instance.
 How did the Falcone and Maroni crime families get such big shares in the deal? I mean, I know city hall is corrupt but why didn't Wayne Enterprises do something? Can you pass me that blue folder? Well, I suppose as hobbies go, this is a damn sight better than grilling yourself like a bloody pork chop.
 Still, not particularly healthy, is it? Thank you.
 Are you listening to me? Yeah, yeah, for sure.
 I'll take a walk later.
 Thank you, Alfred.
 I won a piece of Arkham.
 I strong-armed the mayor I made Falcone back down, and you're telling me I can't rob a lousy casino? Sal, the casino is Falcone's pride and joy.
 I mean, what's the point? For a few thousand bucks, why mess with Falcone? That's the point messing with Falcone.
 I want him and his people to know we're not backing off.
 Arkham was only the beginning.
 We're taking over, Frankie.
 Inch by inch.
 - Yeah, okay, but-- - But, but, but.
 - Make it happen.
 - Okay, boss.
 What are you looking at? You got something to say? No, sir.
 Nothing at all.
 Hey.
 Hey, man! Hey.
 Hey, you gotta pay for that.
 Do not vex me, mortal.
 Yeah? Suit yourself, Zeus.
 Hey, it might look like the heel of a hobo's shoe.
 Best burgers in midtown.
 Huh, Efram? - If you say so.
 - All right, I want two cheeseburgers hold the sauce, extra pickles, two malted shakes.
 - No pickles on mine, please.
 - Oh, you gotta trust me on this one.
 Yeah? All right, pickles.
 Bring them.
 You wanna look good in a swimsuit like me come summertime, you'll want a lot of this and this.
 All right.
 - You! - Hey! Jim.
 Jim! Come on, it's lunchtime.
 Relax.
 It's lunchtime.
 No, Jim.
 We're on our-- It's lunch! Oh, brother.
 Jim, you can't just pop up and jump every time you hear a bell.
 G.
C.
P.
D.
 Anybody here? Unh.
 Over here.
 Oh.
 You all right, sir? You okay? - Thank God you're here.
 - Anybody dead? I don't think so.
 Some guy, he was stealing milk.
 I tried to stop him he hauls away my ATM machine.
 All right, nobody dead.
 We're Homicide, and it's lunch.
 So have a good day, sir.
 Call 911 and someone will take care of you.
 Wait a minute.
 One guy did this? Stole your ATM over milk? Little skinny-ass dude.
 Guitar case.
 Drinking milk like there's no more cows.
 Don't vex me, mortal, he says.
 - I'm sorry, what? - Listen, if I had a dollar for every hobo skeez that walks through that door thinks they're God I wouldn't be here.
 But this son of a bitch, he wasn't fooling around.
 All right.
 You get a description of the vehicle, license, something? He didn't have a vehicle.
 Then how'd he pull your ATM from the wall? How'd he take it away? That's what I'm telling you, man.
 He pulled it out of here with his bare hands.
 I'm bored.
 Poor little baby girl.
 Cooped up in here all the time.
 - You want some excitement.
 - Yes, I do.
 Can we just go somewhere? - Ah! - How's that? Excited now? - What'd you do that for? - Why are you here with me? - I'm your secret weapon.
 - Exactly.
 But are you helping me help you? No, you're not.
 You won't even learn the damn tune.
 I told you this is important.
 - I'm sorry, Mama.
 - I'm not your mama.
 Now, you might be my baby girl, but I'm not your mama.
 Not yet.
 You have to earn that.
 How is that even possible? Who is this guy? No positive ID as of yet.
 He's a street guy.
 We think that this thing has something to do with his excessive joie de vivre.
 Yeah, we found it in the suspect's guitar case.
 It's some drug.
 A drug did that? Wow.
 Nygma found traces of the drug.
 He'll have a read on what this is by tomorrow.
 Meantime, we'll try and ID the strong man.
 Yeah.
 I know your families are upset but tell them everybody got a piece of the Arkham project.
 It was a business decision.
 We didn't lose, Maroni didn't win.
 Maroni thinks he won.
 He thinks he won a great battle.
 - We need to hurt him.
 - No.
 If we don't push back hard, he's going to think-- Nikolai, that fool will think what I want him to think.
 No pushback, not yet.
 In my country, we say, Even a fool may bite the king if he has teeth.
 Can the folklore, Niko.
 We're not in your godforsaken country.
 We are here in Gotham, where we have plumbing, electricity and Don Falcone is the boss.
 He's playing that cluck Maroni on a long line.
 Done.
 Why so angry, Fish? I speak my mind.
 ls no crime.
 And I assure you in my country, we have all modern conveniences.
 Only difference, ladies.
 Ladies are in kitchen or in bed depending on their talents.
 I bet your mother was a lousy cook.
 - Don't speak of my mother.
 - Or what? You're gonna hit a lady? That's enough.
 There'll be no bad blood here.
 My apologies, Don Falcone.
 We need each other.
 We're family.
 Hey.
 - Excuse me.
 You seen this guy, by chance? - No.
 Mm-mm.
 Seen this guy? Excuse me.
 Familiar to you? Any chance you seen this guy? Yeah, I know him.
 It's, uh, Benny.
 He's a guitar player.
 Strung out like a string.
 What'd he do? Uh, nothing bad.
 He came into an inheritance, actually, no one knew about.
 That's right.
 A million dollars.
 Farm, horses, real nice.
 You know where we can find him? Twenty dollars.
 Ten.
 - Same as the bodega.
 - Yeah, what's with all the dairy products? Sir, G.
C.
P.
D.
 Let me see those hands.
 Oh.
 Help me.
 I need more.
 More what? What'd you take? What is it? It felt so good.
 And now I don't feel so good.
 Something's wrong.
 I need more.
 Please.
 You have to find him.
 - Find who? The guy that gave you the stuff? - Yeah.
 The man with a mangled ear.
 With a mangled ear.
 Go ahead.
 Stay calm, we got it.
 We're gonna help.
 Just put your-- - No, no, no.
 - Hey, hey! Sir, we need you to calm down.
 - Calm down.
 - Unh! - I said no.
 - Put it down! What the hell? God help us if that drug gets out.
 Will you look at this shambles? What would your mother say? You know, I have half a mind to stick all this lot straight into the bloody fire.
 - No fire.
 - We'll see about that.
 Come on.
 Up you get.
 Wayne Enterprises is hosting a charitable luncheon tomorrow.
 I took the liberty of accepting their kind invitation on your behalf, Master Bruce.
 Good.
 ls there breakfast? Yeah, I'll make you an egg.
 Does that mean you'll go? Yes.
 I have some questions I need to ask the members of the board.
 - What kind of questions? - About Arkham.
 It seems likely those gangsters were given their shares in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.
 Well, that's how business is done, isn't it? Is it? My parents didn't do business that way, did they? No.
 No, they didn't, Master Bruce.
 The board might not know.
 There's quite a bit of clever camouflage used.
 Shell companies, offshore accounts and so forth.
 Right.
 So you learned all of that from all of this, did you? Fantastic detective work.
 I still want to get the whole lot and chuck it straight in the fire.
 Don't put anything in the fire, Alfred.
 - That's an order.
 - Right, Master Bruce.
 Nothing in the fire.
 We are live in downtown Gotham, where a deadly new drug has hit the streets.
 Nicknamed Viper, users of this mystery drug acquire great strength and a euphoric sense of power, but only for a few brief hours.
 Then without exception, they die a horrible death.
 It's really quite remarkable.
 Viper somehow activates unused DNA.
 The body starts to burn calcium from the skeletal system as fuel hence the victims' cravings for milk and cheese.
 They're desperately trying to replace the missing calcium but they can't consume enough.
 Essentially, their bones crumble, then they suffocate and die.
 - Have you seen anything like this before? - Nobody has.
 Totally new.
 I can't tell you how thrilled I am-- No new reports for a few hours now.
 Maybe they're done.
 Maybe they ran out of the stuff.
 - I doubt it.
 - Who would put this on the street? Why? They're not even selling it.
 They're giving it away.
 - That's how you create demand.
 - For a drug that kills you that fast? First it makes you king of the world.
 There'll be takers.
 There'll be mayhem for sure.
 But it's skell-on-skell mayhem.
 If we keep the decent citizens indoors, let the scumbags have at it? VoilÃ , the end of crime.
 Yeah, that's a nice thought, but no.
 This stuff seems hard to make, no? Oh.
 It takes a high level of technical sophistication.
 A state-of-the-art lab made this stuff.
 So who has the biggest and best lab in the city? The best is WellZyn.
 But this is not them.
 They're a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.
 Multibillion-dollar corporation.
 Why would they do this? I don't know.
 But we might as well start at the top.
 Let go of me.
 Let go of me! Fascinating.
 Fascinating.
 Maybe I should hire that guy to take the casino.
 Maybe you should snort some Viper.
 Either way, I want it taken.
 Sure, we'll take it.
 I mean, it's tight as a nut.
 Ten armed guards, blast-proof doors, cameras.
 We're gonna lose a few guys, but we'll take it.
 Excuse me.
 I couldn't help but overhear your conversation regarding the casino.
 Go mind your business.
 - I'm sorry, of course.
 I'm so sorry.
 - No.
 Tell me.
 What about the casino? I know a janitor who runs the boiler room of the casino.
 He could get you inside quite easily.
 There are access tunnels nobody knows about.
 - Access tunnels? - Sit down.
 Come here.
 Thank you, sir.
 A great honor indeed.
 What's your name again? Everyone here calls me Penguin, sir.
 You don't like that name, huh? Yeah, well, you're wrong.
 It's a good name.
 It works for you.
 So how do you know this man? The janitor? I have connections.
 Reliable, is he? - I think I can persuade him to be.
 - Boss, this guy is a dishwasher in a suit.
 Relax.
 Is that right, Penguin? Are you just a dishwasher? Because I don't get that vibe.
 You come off as all humble, but you got a little player in you, huh? That's very perceptive of you, sir.
 Heh, heh.
 I guess that's why you're the don.
 Well Heh, heh.
 I'm not a dishwasher and this isn't my first rodeo, so to speak.
 - So you rode some bulls, huh? I knew it.
 - Well Well, tell all, cowboy.
 - Well, my real name is Oswald Cobblepot.
 Mm-hm.
 I think that once you hear my story, you'll agree that I could be a great asset for you, sir.
 Mm.
 It's a long, funny story, really, but the headline, just so you're not surprised - I used to work for Fish Mooney.
 - Fish Mooney? Hey.
 Yes, sir.
 I was privy to many aspects of the Falcone family business.
 - Until they tried to kill me.
 Heh, heh.
 - Well Heh, heh.
 - Hello.
 Heh.
 Suffice it to say-- - Heh-heh-heh.
 - That is a funny story.
 - Mm.
 I'm Taylor Reece, general counsel, public relations for WellZyn.
 - Good morning, gentlemen.
 - Thank you for saving us a trip.
 We were en route as soon as we were apprised of your inquiries.
 WellZyn is committed to good community relations.
 - What do you know about Viper? - What we see on the news.
 WellZyn has no connection to this tragedy.
 We will vigorously pursue legal action against any individuals making assertions to the contrary.
 Do you think we push a button, or does she just rewind automatically? We're looking for an employee of WellZyn's.
 Male, with a severely damaged ear.
 Yes.
 Full disclosure, that does raise a flag.
 That's Stan Potolsky.
 He worked for us for several years as a biochemist.
 Primarily personal-care products.
 Shampoos, toothpastes.
 So, what happened? Stan was frustrated that he wasn't doing more important work.
 He grew disgruntled and unstable.
 We tried to get him help, but he resisted.
 Last April, there was an incident.
 He tried to cut off his own ear during a disagreement with his supervisor.
 Guess it was harder than he thought.
 We had to let him go.
 - Last known address? - After he was terminated he didn't even clear off his desk.
 Just disappeared off the grid.
 You knew, didn't you? You knew all along it was him.
 That's why you came to see us so fast.
 That's incorrect.
 Viper can only be produced in a state-of-the-art lab, like yours.
 Stan Potolsky is a brilliant man perfectly capable of building his own lab.
 But you are more than welcome to examine our facilities with full and proper clearances, of course.
 - Of course.
 - We'll get the paperwork started.
 Lawyers.
 Scumbags, the lot of them.
 Eh, some of them.
 Let's go find Stan Potolsky.
 Drive around looking for him? No.
 I'll call Dispatch, have them put out an APB.
 All right.
 I'll check with the desk, see if his name's come up.
 - Gordon, right? - Yeah, who the hell are you? You gotta come with me now, nice and quiet, like.
 - What are you talking about? - We got a mutual friend.
 - Oh, yeah? Who's that? - Oswald Cobblepot.
 Yeah, him.
 And if you don't come with me now we're gonna put his head in a bag and send it to Falcone which would be embarrassing for you, no? Or maybe we've been misinformed.
 If I'm not ringing any bells here, you can go on your merry way.
 No, I'll come.
 All right, shove over.
 Hey, hey! Welcome.
 I'm Salvatore Maroni.
 I know who you are.
 What do you want? - Here's the thing.
 - Jim, just tell the truth.
 You want a drink, Jim? I'm having a Negroni.
 So good with seafood.
 Water.
 So our friend here told me a fascinating story.
 Never heard a story so good.
 It's hard to believe it's true.
 - It is, it's true.
 - Shut up! Shut up! One more word, and I'll jam this down your throat.
 I try to be civil, Jim.
 But I'm not the kind of man that likes to ask twice.
 - So here's how it's gonna go.
 - Slow down, Mr.
 Maroni.
 - I don't know you-- No, no, no.
 You let me finish.
 You'll have your turn to speak.
 Okay, then.
 I want you to tell me the same exact story that Penguin told me.
 What story is that? You'd better know what story, my friend.
 Because if you tell me the same story he told me then I could believe it's true.
 Then I'm happy.
 But if you tell me another story-- Oh, Mama.
 --Then someone's lying to me.
 I don't know which one, then the both of you will die.
 - Understand? - Yes, I do.
 Good.
 So tell me a story, Jim.
 Somebody murdered Thomas and Martha Wayne.
 - I caught the case-- - We didn't know each other then.
 What did I say? Go put him on the slicer.
 No, no, no.
 If I don't like what I hear, slice his face, prosciutt.
 Oh, I'm sorry, go on.
 I was a pawn in a conspiracy between Falcone, the mayor and the G.
C.
P.
D to frame Mario Pepper for the Wayne murders with the help of Fish Mooney, Mr.
 Cobblepot's employer at the time.
 Mr.
 Cobblepot then told the whole story to the MCU.
 To prove that I wouldn't betray the conspiracy Falcone ordered me to kill Cobblepot.
 I didn't do it.
 I let him live.
 And here we are.
 Falcone, Mooney, the MCU cops none of them know he's alive? If they did, I'd be dead already.
 It's delicious.
 Ha-ha-ha.
 Frankie, bring the Penguin back out here.
 The little punk is telling the truth.
 Thank you, Jim.
 Good story.
 Told well.
 A lot of guys in your situation, they freak out.
 There you are, you rat, you snitch you gorgeous turncoat son of a bitch.
 Come here, I love you.
 Mwah.
 Be happy, Frankie.
 We just got a brand-new weapon against the Falcones.
 - It's Christmas.
 - Happy holidays.
 Can I go now? Oh, yeah.
 Jim, you can go.
 Just so that we understand each other we'll keep all this hush-hush between us pals.
 And if I need you again, I'll call you.
 Thank you.
 You do that.
 Look at you, come on.
 Let's get you cleaned up.
 Come on.
 I love you, baby.
 I love you, baby.
 - I love you, baby.
 - Okay, now you're still putting too much sex on it.
 Keep it clean, like a mother.
 I love you, baby.
 I love you, baby.
 Good.
 Better.
 Now, act as if you've caught me in a lie.
 Not angry.
 No.
 Disappointment.
 Oh, honey.
 Oh, honey.
 There you go.
 Now, about your hair There you are.
 Where the hell have you been? Personal business.
 You disappear in the middle of a case, and you can't even tell me why? That's what personal means.
 You in some kind of trouble? Forget it.
 I don't wanna know your problems.
 WellZyn sent by Potolsky's stuff.
 Grab a box.
 - Anything useful yet? - No, classic geeky loner.
 Lived for his work.
 No wife.
 No family.
 No real friends.
 Is it Barbara? She get into something? Uh Yeah.
 Kind of.
 Figures.
 No offense.
 Need any help? No, I'm all right.
 Thanks.
 Hey, what do you think about this? Looks like a friend, no? Judging by the books, the mascot Philosophy professor.
 Gotham U.
 - Worth a shot.
 - Amen.
 I was just on my way to an appointment.
 But, yes, I know Stan Potolsky.
 He was a student of mine, a very brilliant student.
 You've stayed in touch over the years.
 We have.
 He may be a biochemist, but philosophy is a passion of his.
 What can you tell us about WellZyn firing him? Research for WellZyn led him into some dark moral corners.
 WellZyn said he made shampoo.
 Where are the dark moral corners in that? Shampoo? Heh, heh.
 They say that, do they? No, no.
 Stan designed pharmaceutical weapons to be used by combat troops.
 Drugs that worked on an epigenetic level.
 Imagine an army made up of soldiers so strong that they can tear a man apart with their bare hands.
 Of course, at the beginning, there were side effects.
 Yeah, death.
 But Viper was the first batch.
 They worked out the kinks in the second version, called it Venom.
 By then, Stan had acquired some clarity.
 He appealed to his bosses to end the program.
 They refused.
 So he went over their heads, to Thomas and Martha Wayne.
 He convinced them to shut it down.
 And when they died, WellZyn immediately revived the program with the blessings of Wayne Enterprises.
 In the end, there was nothing for Stan to do but to resort to more radical measures.
 Killing people.
 I'm not hearing a sense of moral outrage, professor.
 If you don't mind, I'll reserve my moral outrage for the true villains of this piece.
 You mean WellZyn.
 You planned this with Potolsky.
 - Yes.
 - Where is he? Talk fast, bub.
 What are you gonna do? I'm an old man.
 I'm dying.
 I'll help you die quicker, you terrorist.
 Soon Stan will issue a statement the world can't ignore.
 Soon? Today? - You're already too late.
 - Now you tell us where-- You said you had an appointment? Where are you going? Bravo! You've asked the right question.
 The first step to enlightenment.
 God! - Where is he? Where's Potolsky? - Those hypocrites.
 Empty altruism will not erase what they've done.
 - They must pay.
 - Who? Who must pay? WellZyn, Wayne Enterprises.
 Everyone will finally see them for what they are.
 How? Where's Potolsky headed? What's altruism? Charity.
 I know where he's going.
 - Name, please? - He's Bruce Wayne.
 Master Bruce Wayne.
 - Just this way.
 Thank you.
 - Thank you.
 Wayne Enterprises is a helping hand.
 A port in the storm.
 Ah.
 That's Ms.
 Mathis.
 She worked closely with your father.
 A shelter for all.
 And clean water Please sit, Bruce.
 It is so good to see you out and about.
 Glad to be here.
 All of us at Wayne Enterprises are so sorry for your loss.
 So are all you here on the board? Oh, heavens.
 No, we're middle management.
 The board members don't do this sort of thing.
 No? Why not? Well, they're very busy people, Bruce.
 Your family created a company worth billions and billions of dollars.
 How awesome is that? Awesome.
 I wanted to speak to them because I found what looks like serious irregularities in the Arkham project.
 Irregularities? I can assure you, Bruce, that Wayne Enterprises would never countenance doing business with criminals.
 Just wouldn't happen.
 I hope so, but I'd like to speak directly with the board myself.
 Can you make that happen? I can certainly try.
 They prefer to communicate with minors via the usual legal mediation, but-- Good evening.
 This is a public service announcement on behalf of all living creatures.
 You've heard of a drug called Viper? That's me.
 I made it for WellZyn a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.
 - Is this true? - Of course not, Bruce.
 I mean, this man is clearly insane.
 The AC plant, where is it? - On the roof? - Straight ahead, staircase.
 Clear the ballroom.
 I had hoped that a demonstration using street people would suffice but it seems bad things only truly happen when they happen to important people like you.
 G.
C.
P.
D.
 Everybody out! Turn it off! I can't do that.
 Turn it off or I'll shoot! Go ahead.
 My work is done.
 Turn around, put your hands behind your head! Interlock your fingers! That's all right.
 You're angry and confused.
 I understand.
 There's no more need for violence.
 Don't shoot! That's considerate of you.
 I'm leaving now.
 Go look in Warehouse 39.
 - You're not going anywhere! - I can go anywhere I want! Don't do it.
 You really can have too much of a good thing.
 Nothing.
 What'd you expect? It's Gotham.
 It's Mathis.
 I'm outside the site.
 They're here.
 No, I think we should leave them be.
 There's nothing here for them.
 We'll review that if they get close.
 - It's been 10 minutes.
 - I-- I assure you my friend is reliable.
 Ahem.
 You scared, Penguin? Your voice is doing that shaky thing.
 Heh, heh.
 No, sir.
 I'm fine.
 You don't have to act tough.
 Nerves are a good thing.
 Perhaps I am a bit jittery, sir.
 Good.
 You should be.
 Because if my boys don't make it, neither do you.
 Keep going! Ah.
 Take that, Falcone, you son of a bitch.
 Huh? I told you, Frankie, the kid's a player.
 He's got a future.
 What are you waiting here like an old lady? Go.
 Untie me.
 Say pretty please.
 Please.
 Ah! Sometimes I think you really don't like me.
 Now, would I be backing your takeover if I didn't like you? That stuff with Falcone, well, we have to look good for the old man.
 If he figures out we're working together we'd be cooked.
 Patience.
 - I have no more patience.
 - Mm.
 The old man has to go.
 We must strike soon.
 Yes, mm but softly.
 Excuse me.
 I couldn't help but overhear that aria you were humming.
 - Oh, yes.
 It's my favorite.
 - Mine too.
 Ah, well, there you go.
 I'm sorry.
 I just-- I didn't mean to bother you.
 My mother sang that to me when I was young.
 Her whole life, she sang that to me.
 I hadn't heard it in a while, and I had to smile because you look Anyhow, sorry.
 I'm rambling on.
 No, that's okay.
 Do you wanna listen? Well, yes.
 Sure.
 Thank you.
 Let's sit down.
   

                



                


                    			 There's a war coming.
 A terrible war.
 There will be chaos, rivers of blood in the streets.
 I know it.
 I can see it coming.
 It's time.
 Somebody has to take over.
 It might as well be me.
 Hello, James, old friend.
 Mooney, the MCU cops, none of them know Penguin's alive.
 - If they did, I'd be dead.
 - James Gordon is not a good guy.
 He framed Mario for the murder of the Waynes.
 James Gordon is the most honest man I've ever met.
 This is not a city or a job for nice guys.
 - You're a cynic.
 Slovenly, lackadaisical cynic.
 - You're probably right.
 I am the Spirit of the Goat.
 I am the Spirit of the Goat.
 I am the Spirit of the Goat.
 I am the Spirit of the Goat.
 Gotham still held in a grip of terror as the mysterious masked killer known as the Spirit of the Goat remains on the loose.
 But Gotham's Goat hasn't cast his shadow over Thomas and Martha Wayne's celebration of beloved son Bruce Wayne's third birthday.
 The Wayne family opened their home to the children of the city orphanage - to share in the joyous day - Shelly.
 - Aah! - Shh, Shh, shh.
 That's the van registered to Randall Milkie.
 - We were right, Dix.
 - Of course we're right.
 Dispatch, Detective Dix requesting backup at 1100 Cannery Drive.
 - Roger.
 On your - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 - Come on, man.
 We gotta get in there.
 - Wait a second.
 Listen to me.
 Wait a minute.
 Listen to me.
 Randall thinks he's the reincarnation of some ancient murdering goat spirit.
 - We are waiting for backup.
 - He's got Shelly Lawson.
 If he kills her, that's three people we lost to this maniac.
 No heroes.
 Son of a bitch.
 - Idiot, she's already dead.
 - You don't know that.
 Yeah.
 I know it.
 I told you.
 - Shelly.
 - I told you she'd be cold.
 She's been here half of the night.
 Wait a minute.
 New candles, barely melted.
 Just lit.
 That's great.
 That's great news.
 Randall Milkie, you're under arrest for the murders of Shelly Lawson, Daniel Tremont and Edward Talbot.
 Randall, be smart.
 Come out of there, or we're gonna have to blow you away.
 Randall Milkie is undone.
 Gone.
 This body is moved by the Spirit of the Goat.
 Ah, we're gonna go with Milkie.
 I already did the paperwork.
 Dix! You can never stop the Goat.
 This body may fail, but I will not.
 I will always come back.
 I will always come back.
 Come back from this.
 Milkie.
 Dix! Dix.
 Talk to me.
 Talk to me.
 Dix, come on.
 Come on.
 Dix.
 Help! We got an officer down! We need help, now! Detective Bullock.
 - Detective Bullock, do you give up? - What? My riddle.
 A man has to cross the river with a wolf, a cabbage and a goat.
 Ed, please, what's the time of death? Examiner pegs it at just before 3 a.
m.
 this morning.
 He's a bit eager with his coagulation marker, so I'd put it at closer to 1.
 Killer left her identification for us.
 Amanda Hastings, 21 years old.
 - She comes from money.
 - Mm-hm.
 - Guessing she was the oldest in her family.
 - Why is that? The Goat always kills the firstborn.
 It's all the same.
 Same MO, same victim choice, presentation, it's all the same.
 We got a copycat.
 - You all right, detective? - No, I'm not all right.
 I already solved this case.
 - Where's Gordon? - Apparently, he's not answering his phone.
 He's not answering his? You mean I'm on the clock before the Boy Scout? - Mm-hm.
 - This is frigging ridiculous.
 Fine, I'll tell you the answer.
 The man crosses the river with the wolf and the cabbage.
 - He leaves the wolf, goes back with the cab-- - Ed.
 - I'm not apologizing for my past.
 - I'm not asking you to.
 - You're not listening.
 - No, you're not listening.
 - I'm not asking you to walk away from this.
 - Really? It sounds like you are.
 And we keep going around and around, and I keep telling you I don't have a choice.
 Barbara This city, the law, the crime here, they're all twisted up in each other like a maze.
 I came here to be a cop but the city needs something else.
 It's okay.
 I understand.
 I'm just asking for one thing.
 Half of what you have to carry.
 God knows I've dumped my half on you, and you carry it.
 What I'm dealing with, it's so dangerous.
 Half of what you carry.
 If you think I care about the risk, then you're forgetting who I am.
 I swear I'm not.
 Are we okay? Are we still fighting? We're negotiating terms.
 Hmm.
 That's not good for me.
 You tell me what you're up against okay? You let me in.
 Then we're okay.
 - That's work again.
 - Yep.
 I'll tell you everything.
 Everything I can.
 Okay? I'll make it right.
 Okay.
 Right there.
 We've been canvassing this waterfront for days, Monty.
 None of these river rats are gonna help us.
 If we don't get a lead in the next 24 hours, MCU is dropping this.
 Hey.
 I'm on the disability six months.
 Where do you expect me to go? I'm not flushing you, old-timer, okay? Just wanna ask you some questions.
 About a shooting that took place on that pier back there.
 A shooting? Yeah.
 - I saw it good.
 - Okay.
 Great.
 - You ever see this man? - That was the man did the shooting.
 Cold customer, ice water in the veins.
 We got the son of a bitch.
 We got Gordon.
 - Gotham Goat? - A wannabe.
 For a copycat, the copy is, uh, downright creepy, is what it is.
 - You moonlighting or something? - Huh? Me? Yeah, because you're late, and you look like crap warmed over.
 - Write me up if you want.
 - Screw you, Boy Scout.
 - You're in a good mood.
 - I'm in a dÃ©jÃ  vu acid flashback.
 Someone's hunting the kids of Gotham's 1 percent.
 The press will have a field day.
 City turns upside down.
 The whole thing's gonna come down on the G.
C.
P.
D.
 like a ton of bricks.
 Let's catch him quick.
 I'm guessing the killer knew the victim, Amanda Hastings, somehow.
 We'll go see the family, see if we can try to get something we can work with.
 Hey, Nygma.
 Let me know when they're set up for the autopsy.
 - Anything in particular you want me to--? - Just call me.
 You see, the strange thing, and the horrible thing is that I've been having the same dream for weeks of a dark overbearing presence.
 Mr.
 Hastings, about your daughter, and we know that this is difficult but did she have anyone in her life that worried you? - Anyone who might have wished her harm? - Everybody loved my Amanda.
 Mr.
 Hastings, are you all right? Robert, if you need to take a moment, I'm sure it will be all right.
 Absolutely.
 Come on.
 I know you gentlemen are working against the clock but I'm afraid Mr.
 and Mrs.
 Hastings might not be ready for this.
 I can see that.
 And you are the Hastings' therapist, Dr.
 Marks? Yes.
 I treat mostly Mr.
 Hastings, but we've had many family sessions.
 Mr.
 Hastings has a very delicate nature.
 He's not capable of dealing with this kind of tragedy.
 No one's capable of dealing with this kind of tragedy.
 It's a freight train.
 It runs you over, and you try to pick up what's left.
 You don't believe in treatment.
 I believe in the tranquilizers you clobbered Mrs.
 Hastings with.
 - If you're giving out samples - Okay.
 Uh - Detective, maybe we should, uh - Yeah, you're right, we should.
 Excuse me.
 - Thank you, doctor.
 Mm-hm.
 Uh-huh.
 All right, got it.
 And got it.
 Yes, sir, I'll bring those files right away.
 - Mr.
 Nygma.
 - Hello, Miss Kringle.
 I'm just looking for all the information you have on the Goat murders from 10 years ago.
 Don't you find it curious why someone would resurrect the myth of a centuries-old bogeyman? What is it about the Goat that has made two people decide to kill in his name? No, I don't find it curious.
 - I think I would like your parents.
 - Excuse me? Kringle.
 Such a rare surname.
 Most people changed it generations ago out of embarrassment.
 Not only did your parents keep it, they called you Kristin.
 Kristin Kringle.
 Ha, ha.
 They must be very humorous people.
 Humor is so important, don't you think? Remember, you have to sign out any evidence you pull.
 How do you find anything at all in here? I mean, organizationally speaking, this place is a shambles.
 I am warning you, Nygma.
 I have this as exactly as I want it.
 I know where everything is.
 - Understand? - Preternaturally.
 But I can help you, Kristin Kringle.
 I doubt that very much.
 There is a much better way to do this.
 Amanda Hastings was last seen entering this building Tuesday midnight.
 That's about 36 hours ago.
 You think she was abducted from here? I don't know.
 It was Milkie's MO 10 years ago.
 He took each one of the victims from their homes.
 - But CSI found no signs of a break-in.
 - They didn't with Randall either.
 He worked for an air-conditioning maintenance crew that covered all three buildings.
 He had keys? He had keys.
 This is Detective Gordon.
 I need the employee list of every maintenance and janitorial company with access to the Hastings' building.
 Yeah, I'll tell him.
 They're ready for the autopsy.
 Mother! Away for so long, and now he scratches at the door the filthy tomcat.
 Hi, Mom.
 I'm alive.
 Why you always think I'm running off with some painted lady? - I don't even date.
 - Ha! Why you don't call your mother in all this time? I tell you why.
 You got tangled in some hussy's demon purse.
 Mother, there was no hussy.
 Only betrayal and savagery and All I wanted was a little respect.
 And they hurt me so cruelly.
 - Oh.
 There was no other woman? - Heh-heh-heh.
 I have been to hell and back.
 They tried to kill me.
 The bullies again.
 My poor, poor darling.
 They only do these things because they resent you.
 Envy and spite that's all it is.
 You watch, Ma.
 I'm gonna be somebody in this town.
 I always knew this.
 The victim was asphyxiated, likely with ether or chloroform.
 Look under the scalp.
 Humor me.
 At the base of the skull, there'd be an incision about an inch long sewn closed.
 Wait a minute.
 Yes.
 How did I miss that? An incision stitched closed near the occipital.
 Over a foreign object.
 - What is it? - It's a penny.
 He's right.
 - A penny? - I know Milkie's MO.
 No one could know that detail.
 It isn't a copycat.
 It can't be.
 Ten years ago Randall Milkie took an 1813 Liberty penny just like this one and sewed it into the heads of each of his victims.
 Why? How the hell do I know? He bum-rushed me wearing animal horns.
 - I shot him.
 We didn't talk coin collecting.
 - You're sure no one else found this out? Milkie was the definition of a loner.
 He didn't tell anybody.
 - We left it out of the file intentionally.
 - Suppressed evidence.
 We Easter-egged it.
 A killer like the Goat had a good chance of drawing admirers.
 Yeah, it's copycat porn.
 We left out this one detail.
 The coins.
 It never hit the papers.
 How the hell did this copy-Goat know about this? Okay, so you hid it, but the medical examiner, he had to know.
 Ed Hayes, yeah, sure.
 But he died of cirrhosis.
 That just leaves me.
 And Dix.
 - Captain, please, there's no reason-- - Go talk to him.
 Make sure he didn't tell anyone about the coins.
 Hell, see if he's got any ideas.
 I'm Lacey White, and this is the Gotham Seven Goatwatch.
 Tonight, Gotham's wealthiest 1 percent rest fitfully.
 .
.
 under a copycat killer's deadly shadow.
 And if you happen to be one of the city's high-society silver spoons then you're probably headed to the Swiss Alps right now and away from - They've got them all running like rabbits.
 - Yeah.
 I don't know why he chose an ungulate for his totem but he does know how to scare them.
 You do realize you happen to be one of them, don't you, Master Bruce? Yeah, a firstborn son of Gotham's rich and powerful.
 I don't know, maybe we should leave town for a little bit.
 Pop down to the lake house.
 You like it there.
 I'm not going anywhere.
 I have work to do.
 Besides why would the Goat take me? There's no one to take me from.
 - Oh, my God.
 - I'm improving your system.
 Implementing a rhizomatic cross index, with your case files classified by subject but arranged more like the way a peat-moss organism grows.
 You know, laterally.
 - I had this entire room organized.
 - Yes, but now it will be rhizomatic.
 Lateral.
 What did I ever do to you, Nygma? What did I do that compels you to come here with your endless suggestions and riddles? My god, the riddles.
 Are you trying to get me to quit? - You can't want my job.
 - No, no, no.
 I want you.
 To keep your job and to have it here for working.
 Okay.
 I'm getting a sense that this was somehow inappropriate.
 You are so odd.
 I'll just take my nonhierarchical data paradigms out of your hair and leave you to your work.
 How long has it been since you've seen this guy? Bullock, I know what happened.
 Anybody in your situation-- Listen.
 You think you can shrink my head, Boy Scout? You can't.
 This is the black box, man.
 And we don't open the black box, ever.
 - Okay, fine.
 - Why don't you sit your ass down? I'll be back in a few minutes.
 We're both on this case.
 - Dix.
 - Hey.
 What do we have here? Harvey Bullock, boy detective.
 Look at you up there, huh, living the high life? And me down here, all broken up with a busted liver.
 Don't put that on me, old man.
 Your bum liver's between you and the bottle.
 I just busted up your gams and put you in that chair.
 - No heroes, Bullock.
 - No heroes.
 Listen, Dix, we have to talk about the case.
 About the Goat.
 I was wondering when you would ask for my help.
 - I'm not asking for your help.
 - That don't mean you don't need it.
 Who's this? Your partner? - James Gordon.
 Nice to meet you.
 - Come on, Dix.
 Did you ever tell anyone about Randall Milkie? The Liberty pennies? We said we weren't going to.
 We sealed them.
 I know we sealed them, you jackass.
 I told you to seal them.
 Okay, but this new killer's doing the same thing.
 He's stitching up coins in the heads of his victims.
 Any idea how he came up with that? I didn't tell anybody.
 Ed Hayes didn't tell nobody.
 And you didn't tell nobody.
 - So, what the hell does that mean? - It means we were wrong about Milkie.
 - He was not working alone.
 - No.
 Mm-hm.
 You do not have a copycat killer here.
 You do not have a lone killer.
 What you have is a conspiracy.
 A conspiracy to hang rich kids off local historical landmarks? Yeah, right.
 He always thinks he's the smartest one in the room.
 I know, right? That's because I'm always in a room full of idiots.
 Watch out for him.
 - Oh, yeah? Why's that? - He's a loose cannon.
 He thinks he's a white knight, jumping into the breach like some idiot in the movies.
 We talking about Bullock here? - We're talking about Bullock here.
 - Harvey Bullock? Harvey Bullock.
 Detective Bullock, do you wanna settle the bill or should we send it to you? You can just put it in the mail, thanks.
 - Is he getting those magazines I ordered? - Those are awful magazines, detective.
 - But he's getting them? - Yes, he is.
 Good.
 Thank you.
 No, Mom, I'm just grabbing a few things.
 Yes.
 Yes, I know.
 I'll be at the marina at 9.
 Okay.
 - Here you are.
 - Thank you, Anita.
00 at the marina.
 When she didn't show, they came back, found the maid out cold, Ember gone.
 - You think it's our guy? - It's our guy.
 He slips in, chloroforms the maid, grabs Ember.
 - No sign of B and E, nothing, like a ghost.
 - Like he had keys.
 Randall Milkie had a ritual.
 Dress the victims, kill them, do his coin trick.
 Whole thing took eight hours.
 If our copy-Goat's doing the same thing, we're running out of time.
 I pulled the employee list from the agencies that do maintenance on Copley's building.
 Looking for an employee that had access to both victims' apartments.
 - That's a lot of people.
 - Yeah, but our guy's been busy.
 He had to have called in sick the last couple days.
 Get Nygma in there.
 He's freaky good with puzzles.
 You got it.
 - Renee, we have to talk.
 - What are you doing here? I know you think he's done terrible things, but I also know you care about the truth.
 You shouldn't be here.
 You shouldn't be seen here.
 Damn it, Renee, will you listen to me? I'll work with you, okay? I will tell you whatever I know, whatever I can find out.
 - I need you to keep an open mind, okay? - It's too late for that.
 Whatever's happening, you've got it wrong, Renee.
 He can't tell me, but it isn't what you think.
 He's trying to protect me.
 He won't tell me who's out there, who he's afraid of.
 He's right not to.
 - Wait, why? - Because it'll get you killed.
 Okay? You understand? What he knows, who he knows, will kill you.
 We got a judge issuing a warrant tonight.
 You know how much I care about you.
 When Gordon gets arrested, get out of here.
 If Jim gets arrested, then this is exactly where I have to be, by his side.
 Please, just leave.
 Get out of Gotham just till this is over.
 And don't come to me again.
 So four guys have called in sick since last week.
 The suspects from the outer boroughs are cleared, another is out of state but apparently, it's unconfirmed, so - So that leaves one last guy.
 - Raymond Earl.
 Shift supervisor says he's been squatting in a place near Cannery Park around the 1100 block.
 - That's him.
 - You sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
 I'm 100 percent sure.
 DÃ©jÃ  voodoo all day long.
 This is where we got Randall Milkie This is where Dix fell.
 Bullock.
 - Gotta go in.
 Come on.
 - Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We're going to put you to sleep for good now.
 You're lucky to be the sacrifice.
 Go get her.
 It's okay.
 You're safe.
 You all right? Okay.
 You'll never stop the Goat.
 - I will always come back.
 - Quit saying that.
 Raymond Earl, you're under arrest.
 Not bad.
 All right.
 All right.
 Your suit is ready.
 - I steamed it nice.
 - Thanks, Mom.
 Mm-hm.
 I'm worried for you.
 So anxious you look.
 These moves you make they're safe, yes? - You're not doing anything illegal? - No, Mom, don't worry.
 - It's just business.
 - Well, business is all very fine.
 But always remember, you can trust no one.
 No one but your mother.
 I know.
 I know.
 But you know what? I think I finally found somebody I can trust.
 - A policeman.
 - Police? - The police are liars.
 - Mm-mm.
 Not this one, Mom.
 He's a real friend.
 Hmph.
 He'll help me come out right in the end.
 Raymond Earl, 33 years old.
 Janitor in the city.
 Works with an agency that services the buildings of both victims.
 And he's not talking.
 History of mental illness, misdemeanor arrest for lewd and lascivious, public disturbance Thank you, Jesus.
 You got him.
 Good work, detectives.
 I got a lot of phone calls to make.
 Bullock, look happier.
 What? Randall Milkie worked for a company that serviced the buildings of his victims.
 Same as Raymond here.
 Milkie was mentally ill.
 No violent crimes in his history.
 Same as him.
 Ten years apart, they never meet, and one day, suddenly out of the blue they both decide to become the Goat? It's like It's like something found them, changed them.
 Are you talking about Dix and his conspiracy theory? No, no.
 It just doesn't add up.
 How'd he know about the coin? I know that we're missing something, and if we keep missing it l'm afraid we're never gonna stop this.
 Okay.
 We go back to Milkie's files, we look for possible accomplices, connections.
 Tomorrow, tomorrow.
 I just-- I need to think.
 Why don't you get some rest? Yeah.
 Good night.
 Good night, Jim.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 Oh, no.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 Holy Ghost on a bicycle.
 Barbara? Jim, look, I don't know everything, but I know enough.
 You have to listen to me now.
 - Baby, I can barely stand.
 - Montoya has a witness.
 - What? - They believe you killed this Cobblepot person.
 - I didn't.
 - It doesn't matter anymore.
 They've got a warrant for your arrest.
 What aren't you telling me? For weeks now, it's like you've been a different person.
 Something happened not long after you started the job, something Something you don't feel right about.
 Somehow they've cornered me.
 - Tied my hands.
 - Come with me now.
 I don't care what I leave behind as long as we leave it together.
 If they take you away, Jim, I'm scared I'll lose you.
 - Barbara-- - Please.
 I can't run.
 Can't run.
 James Gordon you're under arrest for the murder of Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.
 You have the right to remain silent.
 Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
 You're drifting down and away, deeper-- - I got it.
 - I'm sorry to interrupt.
 It's Detective Bullock, isn't it? Did you wanna interview Mr.
 Hastings? Your secretary told me I might be able to find you here.
 I was hoping to pick your brain about the case.
 Oh.
 Uh, I'll just be a minute.
 It's okay.
 I didn't realize this before.
 You're a hypnotist, right? - A hypnotherapist.
 - Oh, therapist.
 It's a funny word, therapist.
 It can either mean therapist or the rapist if So you do pro bono work at an outpatient clinic or a couple of them? - I do.
 I try to give back.
 - Yeah, you've been giving back for a while.
 - Uh Twelve years now.
 - Mm-hm.
 That's good.
 To be honest, I wanted to talk to you about one of your pro bono patients.
 Raymond Earl.
 He's a person of interest in our investigation.
 Our records indicate you've seen him at least a few times, right? Hmm.
 Sounds familiar.
 Last year, maybe? And Mr.
 Hastings, Amanda's father, we know he's your patient.
 When we were here yesterday, he was doing something really curious.
 He kept clenching his fist, over and over.
 - Yes, he does that.
 - Yeah.
 See, I was reading about that, and it said that if a patient has a compulsion like a bad idea or an impulse that the hypnotist can put the poor sap under and introduce a physical movement like clenching your fist.
 So instead of doing what the compulsion wants the person to do they just clench their fist.
 That's how it works.
 Pretty much.
 So Mr.
 Mm-hm.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 What about Raymond Earl? Why does he clench his fist? And What about Randall Milkie? I know you treated him over 10 years ago, and I want you to follow me because this part gets weird.
 See, I think a hypnotist completely turned both those men upside down until their own identity was the bad idea and then it wasn't even them clenching their fists anymore.
 It was the Spirit of the Goat.
 Hmm.
 I underestimated you.
 - I really did.
 - So I'm right.
 Aha! Yes.
 I'm right.
 So you trawled the outpatient clinics so you could find a suitable borderline case like Randall Milkie and then you hypnotize the poor bastard until he doesn't even know who he is.
 And then I tell him who he is.
 That's pretty good intellection, detective.
 Why? Why hypnotize a janitor and turn him into the Goat? - You wouldn't understand.
 - Try me.
 It isn't an act of murder or madness.
 It's an act of therapy.
 - Therapy? For who? - For Gotham.
 - Excuse me? - This city used to have hope.
 And they gunned it down in the streets, the rich, the powerful.
 Their greed is pathological, an id run rampant, eating Gotham alive.
 So your 1 percent solution is to kill the city's rich kids? Negative reinforcement.
 To believe that the Goat is real that it wouldn't tolerate this? Gotham wanted that, no matter how painful it was.
 It's true what they say.
 You can't really hypnotize somebody to do something that deep down they don't already want to do.
 And deep down we all wanna eat the rich.
 Tell me.
 You are 100 percent nuthouse crazy, lady.
 - Dr.
 Marks, is everything okay? - No, it's not.
 Dr.
 Marks, you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder coercion and a few things we'll probably have to name after you.
 Well, I do have another one for you.
 Robert, the golden temple is open.
 Now, kill this man.
 - Aah! - No, Robert--! You must die.
 Freeze, lady! One more time, take me through the part where you drove to the nice part of town and shot the doctor lady? We caught the other half of the killer.
 Dr.
 Marks was the Spirit of the Goat.
 That's the part that I don't-- We're on the same side.
 You understand? We're fighting the same war, and I'm getting somewhere.
 - Getting into a 6-by-8 at Blackgate Pen.
 - What is this? MCU's taking Detective James Gordon in custody.
 - What? - Your boy here murdered Oswald Cobblepot.
 - That's a damn lie.
 - He's right.
 It was a lie.
 I didn't shoot Oswald Cobblepot.
 I lied.
 I didn't shoot him, Bullock.
 - Of course you didn't, partner.
 - No, I mean it.
 - Harvey Bullock, you're under arrest.
 - For what? Accomplice in the murder of Oswald Cobblepot.
 Our witness places you at the scene.
 You think you can walk in here and take my people like that? We're not here to take down the G.
C.
P.
D.
, just these two.
 They're G.
C.
P.
D.
, so the MCU's got a problem.
 Yeah, you got a problem.
 You got a real problem, you - Holy crap.
 - Hello.
 I am Oswald Cobblepot.
 - You son of a bitch.
 - Harvey.
 You son of a bitch!   

                



                


                    			There's a war coming.
 A terrible war.
 There will be chaos.
 Rivers of blood in the streets, I know it.
 I can see it coming.
 It's time.
 Somebody has to take over.
 It might as well be me.
 - My name's James Gordon.
 A detective.
 - My name is Bruce Wayne.
 I will find the man who did this.
 Stop or I'll shoot! Mario Pepper was framed by Fish Mooney and the cops.
 Why snitch on your own boss? You want to push Fish out.
 I told you this is important.
 I ain't looking for no girl.
 I'm looking for a weapon.
 The old man has to go.
 If he figures out we're working together, we're cooked.
 You're under arrest for the murder of Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.
 - Holy crap.
 - I am Oswald Cobblepot.
 You son of a bitch.
 He's alive? Alive! No.
 Boss, what's wrong? Gordon didn't kill Penguin like he was told.
 - What? - Penguin is alive and working for Maroni? No.
 You go find Gordon and you bring him to me.
 Still breathing.
 I wanna talk to that son of a bitch.
 Hey.
 Leave a message.
 Barbara, if you're at home, listen to me.
 I need you to get out right now.
 - I thought we were friends.
 - Harvey.
 Shut up.
 Game's over.
 Now I gotta kill you, take your body back to Falcone and beg-- Beg him for mercy! Listen to me.
 I screwed up.
 But I have a plan to make things right.
 Don't kill me.
 Help me.
 You think I'm an idiot? Walk away.
 Walk away.
 Help me.
 - We don't have to go out like this.
 - You better hope you never see me again.
 Wow.
 What a place, huh? A beautiful home for a beautiful lady.
 Please tell me what you want.
 I guess there's no harm in the truth.
 See, your boyfriend was supposed to kill a certain person for somebody, only he didn't.
 And now that somebody is real mad.
 Heh.
 - Cobblepot.
 - What? He didn't kill Cobblepot.
 There you go! You're hip.
 You are hip.
 That Jim Gordon is one lucky son of a gun.
 What, are you like 100 pounds? One-ten? I bet that's your real hair color too.
 What are you gonna do to Jim? You ever been with a criminal? Some ladies find it a turn-on.
 - Jim.
 - Hey.
 Speak of the devil.
 I was getting to know your lady.
 You're trespassing.
 Get out.
 Slow down.
 You're misreading the situation.
 I'm the shot-caller here.
 You've been told to bring me in alive or I'd be dead.
 I'm happy to kill you right here.
 Don't be such a hard ass.
 Come on, you know the rules.
 You play nice.
 You take your lumps.
 Nobody else gets hurt.
 Tell your friend to drop his gun or I'll blow his brains out.
 - Oh, my God.
 Jim.
 - It's under control.
 Drop your gun.
 Okay.
 Have it your way.
 But now, after we kill you, we're gonna kill blondie too.
 Nice and slow.
 We've gotta go.
 Right now.
 Barbara.
 Westbound interstate express departs in five minutes, Bay 12.
 Barbara.
 - What? - Listen.
 No.
 No.
 - Just a couple of days and I'll join you.
 - No.
 There are things I need to do.
 Fine.
 Then if you stay, I stay.
 Okay? Because I love you, Jim.
 I cannot leave you.
 I love you too.
 That's why you need to leave.
 If I know you're safe, there is nothing they can do to me.
 I'll make things right.
 And then I'll come join you.
 And what if you don't? Don't come back.
 Don't come back to Gotham.
 No, Jim.
 Gordon's here.
 He's nuts.
 What's he doing? You believe this guy? Hey, Alvarez.
 You got any of those blank warrants that Judge Barn Barn signed? Uh Yeah.
 This cannot stand.
 Gordon must die.
 Bullock must die.
 Penguin must die.
 Today.
 - And Maroni too, I suppose? - If need be.
 You're overreacting, my dear.
 This Penguin's a nobody.
 You want to start a war over the guy that carried your umbrella? He was on my hip everywhere with me.
 He knows things.
 Like what? Too much.
 He knows too much.
 Go to Maroni and ask him politely to hand over your little man.
 Politely.
 If he refuses, we can talk about stronger measures.
 Boss, this is weak response.
 I hate to agree with Fish, but we need to show strength now.
 We need to hit back hard.
 No talk.
 Penguin dead.
 Gordon dead.
 Done.
 Relax, Niko.
 I know what I'm doing.
 Where is Gordon? You were bringing him with you.
 No.
 He wouldn't come without a struggle.
 I don't know if he's playing tough or crazy, but he's at work like nothing's wrong.
 I'll send Victor to fetch him.
 No need.
 My guys can handle him.
 I'll send Victor.
 That's a nice handsome bird, huh? I don't know chickens.
 - Ugh.
 - Fall back.
 The old man is right there.
 Screw him.
 He's done.
 Now's the time to strike.
 - Not yet.
 - Not yet.
 Not yet.
 If not now, when? Look at him.
 Maroni clan are laughing at us and he plays with chickens.
 That's what has me worried.
 The chickens.
 He's happy, relaxed, as if he doesn't have a care in the world.
 - That girl of yours is doing her job, then.
 - No.
 She says he hasn't even touched her.
 She cooks and she cleans for him.
 - He likes to watch her do chores.
 - Weird.
 - But if that's his thing - No.
 He's acting as if he knows something important that no one else knows.
 What the hell are you doing here? I work here.
 It's my shift.
 Where else should I be? How about Alaska? Arrest warrants? For who? Mayor Aubrey James, Carmine Falcone, and their close associates.
 On charges of conspiracy and perversion of justice in the Wayne case.
 - Are you insane? - No.
 Maybe a little.
 Feels good.
 They're gonna try and kill me anyway.
 Might as well make them pay for it.
 You're gonna arrest the mayor and Don Falcone.
 How? My testimony is attached to the warrants.
 That's enough to indict on a dozen counts.
 True.
 If you could execute the warrants, which you can't.
 If the DA would prosecute, which he won't.
 There's not a cop or lawyer in the city who'll help you.
 There are people willing to help once they see it's possible to fight back.
 You're dreaming.
 Nobody will help you.
 I won't help you.
 You don't think I want change, just like you do? I have a family.
 I understand.
 Gordon get out of town.
 This is my home.
 It was my father's home.
 I'm not leaving.
 Hello, everyone.
 My name is Victor Zsasz.
 I'm sent here personally by Don Carmine Falcone himself on a matter of deep concern to him, so please be respectful.
 I'm here for Jim Gordon.
 Only him.
 Everybody else, mind your business and we're cool.
 So where's Jim at? Thank you.
 Hey, Jim! Jim.
 Hi, Jim.
 Relax.
 I'm supposed to take you in alive.
 Don Falcone wants to talk.
 Tell Falcone we'll talk, but not today.
 Don't be that way.
 Alive is a very broad category.
 A man with no hands can still be alive.
 There are 50 cops in here.
 Try something.
 Everybody out.
 Please! Go, boss.
 Get out of here.
 - Jim-- - Go.
 I can handle this.
 Well, how now, Jim? Jim? Jim? Why are you hiding from me, Jim? Hey! What the--? There.
 You need a ride? Go.
 Go.
 Go.
 No.
 Please.
 Twenty-eight.
 Ah.
 You're back.
 How do you feel? Terrible.
 Where am I? Who are you? I'm a friend of Montoya and Allen.
 I took two bullets out of you, sewed you up.
 Now I'm checking to see how you're doing.
 So who are you? What city are we in? And what day of the week is it? I'm James Gordon.
 We're in Gotham.
 It's Friday.
 Why are there rats? It's the dissection lab at the university.
 I gather you're a fugitive from the mob.
 Can't go to the hospital, said Crispus.
 Very exciting, I must say.
 - How long have I been out? - Just a couple of hours or so.
 You're very lucky no vital organs were-- Whoa.
 Lie back down.
 Okay, you were hurt.
 Just a week or so in bed-- - No, I have to go.
 - James, you have lost a lot of blood.
 You have to do as I say and lie back down.
 If you don't, you could die.
 I have to stand.
 Can you help me? Okay.
 Okay.
 Crispus.
 - He said he's leaving already.
 - I have to go.
 Now.
 Sure.
 Some clothes would be good though.
 This is about tradition.
 Values.
 Snitches get stitches.
 That's how it's always been.
 You need to hand him over, Sal.
 I know.
 I should.
 But what can I say? - The little guy amuses me.
 - Heh.
 Don Falcone is going to be very unhappy.
 You wanna start a war over this punk? War? Whoa.
 - He's that important to you, is he? - Oh, no.
 He means nothing to us.
 Respect is what matters here.
 Respect, I understand.
 Penguin, come on out here.
 Don't be scared.
 She won't bite.
 You won't bite him, will you? Hello, Penguin.
 Hello, Ms.
 Mooney.
 Penguin, Ms.
 Mooney and her boss, Mr.
 Falcone feel disrespected by you.
 Oh, dear.
 That certainly has never been my intention.
 Well, respect is very important to them.
 Now, I want a sincere apology from you for making them feel that way.
 Oh.
 Gosh, of course.
 If I've, in any way, caused anyone to feel a lack of respect, I apologize.
 Sincerely.
 There you go.
 Can't say fairer than that.
 Bloodshed then.
 I'm glad.
 Jolly fat men are so tiresome.
 And you.
 You little scaly-faced bitch.
 Oh.
 What I'm gonna do to you.
 Torture's far too nice of a word.
 I'm sorry you feel that way, Fish.
 Ungh! Only my friends call me Fish.
 Hey, Sisters.
 How's it hanging? Holy--! Tell your boss Falcone won't let any of Maroni's trucks over the bridge.
 Not till he gives up Penguin.
 Listen, you gotta get hurt a little.
 - You want a beating or a bullet? - Why we gotta get hurt? Because we're sending a message this is a serious issue.
 We'll tell him it's serious.
 No problem.
 Eh, you know what? How did they find out about the gun truck, huh? That's 3 mil per week, right there.
 Son of a bitch! Four and a half mil per, gross.
 Cash.
 A very aggressive move, isn't it? An overreaction.
 They want to scare you.
 You think that they think that Don Maroni can be scared? Of course you're right, no.
 But why then would they react so ferociously? - Why do they want me back so badly? - I know why.
 Because they know I got a stone money-maker here.
 A golden goose.
 They know it and they don't want us to have him.
 Right, Penguin? Honk, honk.
 Heh, heh.
 - What? - Honk, honk.
 - It's what geese say.
 - Right, right.
 Honk, honk.
 So fine.
 He's a goose.
 Maybe we can negotiate a price.
 Pay him off.
 - Yeah.
 - Yes.
 Caution is wise.
 The Falcone clan still is number one.
 Paying them off is the safe thing to do.
 Screw safe.
 They wanna push me? They think I'm gonna fold? I'll push right back.
 Harder.
 Hit them where it hurts.
 Today.
 You know best.
 If that's how you wanna play it I think I know just the spot to hit them.
 I owe you an apology.
 You were telling the truth and I wouldn't believe you.
 Maybe my personal feelings towards Barbara got tangled up in there.
 - That was wrong.
 - Forget it.
 Anyhow, I'm sorry for misjudging you and I'm glad that we're on the same side now.
 Yeah, me too.
 So Barbara's safe though? You sure she's safe? I'm sure.
 Unh! Agh.
 Gordon, is that you? It's all right, Alfred.
 He's a friend.
 We couldn't risk a direct approach.
 People are looking for me.
 - All right.
 - Agh! Sorry about that, mate.
 Can't be too careful.
 In a spot of bother, are we, sir? Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen.
 - Pleased to meet you.
 - Bruce.
 I promised I would find your parents' killer.
 I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to keep that promise.
 It's a long story, but I'm kind of in a tight spot.
 I've upset some powerful people.
 Stop treating me like a child.
 - Explain.
 - You are a child.
 You don't need to know-- You expect to die! I'd like to know why.
 Is it connected to my parents' murder? Yes.
 It's all connected.
 Somehow.
 Bruce.
 I will do my best to work this thing out, but if I don't Montoya and Allen here will take over your parents' case.
 I've told them everything I know.
 You can trust them, 100 percent.
 One hundred percent.
 Bruce, these are good detectives.
 If anyone can find the truth, it's them.
 Thank you.
 Sir, what can we do to help you now? Nothing.
 From here on in, I have to go it alone.
 I don't want anyone else caught up in this.
 - I have to go.
 - You can hardly walk.
 I'll be fine.
 This way.
 Not much further.
 It's there.
 Told you.
 Easy as pie.
 There must be a million dollars' worth here.
 Yeah, you told us, all right.
 You're clever.
 You're very clever.
 I sense a sarcastic and hostile edge to your tone.
 Hostile? You got that right.
 You ain't no golden goose.
 You're a yellow rat snitch and you got Maroni all twisted.
 I'm so glad we're finally clearing the air, at last.
 That's it.
 bang.
 See, then I go back and I tell the boss that one of Nike's men shot you.
 Gee, that's too bad.
 End of story.
 Yes, that's clever enough.
 I never doubted your intelligence.
 That's not your problem.
 Oh, I got a problem, huh? I got a problem.
 No.
 You got a problem.
 What's my problem, shmo? What drives you? What's your passion? When you know what a man loves, you know what can kill him.
 Do you believe this guy? For you, it's money.
 You love money.
 More than power and respect.
 You're a skinflint, Mr.
 Carbone.
 A cheapskate.
 What are you guys 'May-mg an Let me gm! - Sorry, Frankie.
 - What? - As I say, a Cheapskate.
 - Hey, come on! And consequently, you don't pay your people enough.
 Oh, no.
 You don't want to do this.
 - It is a sad fact - Stop, you don't want to do this.
 - that there is no loyalty among thieves.
 - No, no.
 No! The simple offer of a substantial pay raise is all it took to sway these fine men.
 So you see, that's your problem.
 Your greatest passion becomes your greatest weakness.
 Love Mr.
 Carbone.
 Love conquers all.
 Shh.
 My friend.
 My good friend, today is a sad day.
 Nikolai was like a son to me.
 Just as Frankie was a son to you.
 We've both lost precious family members.
 - My condolences to you.
 - And mine to you.
 I want this violence to stop.
 Business is good.
 The Arkham Project is a gold mine.
 Wayne Enterprises is back in play.
 Life is good for all of us.
 Why risk all of that to go to war over trifles? Your little man there is obviously very valuable to you.
 We'll let you have him, unharmed.
 Our gift to you.
 And as a show of mutual respect, you give us something in return.
 Like such as what? How about real estate? One of your warehouses on the river, maybe.
 That's not gonna work.
 I mean, I like this fella, but we're talking about a warehouse on the river.
 Yeah.
 Indian Hill.
 I'll give you Indian Hill.
 I'm not familiar with the name.
 It's in Arkham.
 It's a toxic waste dump on an Indian burial ground.
 It's worthless.
 Oh.
 Nothing is worthless.
 Even nothing is worth something.
 We'll take it.
 As a token of our mutual respect, yes? You got it, my friend.
 It's all love.
 Heh, heh.
 It's a pleasure seeing you all.
 Um, I heard Vic Zsasz tore up the G.
C.
P.
D.
 tracking down Gordon.
 Did you catch him yet? We're working on it.
 Well, good luck with that.
 There's nothing more dangerous than an honest man, huh? Jimbo, it's me.
 Open up.
 - Hey.
 - Don't worry.
 I'm not gonna kill you.
 I should, but I ain't.
 Glad to hear it.
 You figured you'd go to the last place they'd look because it'd be the first place they'd reject as being too obvious.
 Sorry, I'm being rude.
 This is the Duchess of Devonshire.
 Duchess, Jim Gordon, putz.
 - Marsha.
 Hi.
 - Hi.
 Baby, why don't you explore a little bit? Find the bedroom.
 Put on your birthday suit and I'll find you in a jiffy, okay? So I've been thinking, you're still a douche bag.
 But you have the moral high ground.
 So I'm gonna back your play, whatever it is.
 I figure I'm doomed anyhow.
 I might as well join the good guys.
 Thank you.
 So, what is your play? You got one, right? You said you did.
 Tomorrow morning, I'm arresting Falcone and the mayor for framing Mario Pepper.
 For conspiracy, P.
O.
J.
, RICO, the works.
 Wow, that's a hell of a plan.
 You sit down with chimpanzees and a bucket of crack and come up with that? Whatever else happens, we'll stir things up.
 We might even make the papers.
 We'll make the papers, all right.
 We'll be dead in time for the evening edition.
 The people will know the truth.
 We'll go out doing our jobs.
 Enforcing the law.
 That's the best inspirational speech you got? Doing our jobs? - You don't have to join me.
 - No, I'm game.
 Like I said, I'm doomed anyhow.
 Now, if you'll excuse me for one minute.
 Just gonna take care of some business.
 Duchess! Marco.
 Polo.
 Jumping catfish.
 Good morning, Mayor James.
 Gordon, you scared the bajeebers out of me.
 Almost spilled my coffee.
 Sorry.
 Sir, you're under arrest.
 That's not funny.
 Depends where you're sitting.
 Might wanna take a look at this.
 How you doing, guys? I'm here to have a chat with Mr.
 Falcone.
 Sure thing, Mr.
 Mayor.
 Carmine Falcone, you're under arrest.
 Move.
 Lie down right over there.
 Stay quiet.
 What on earth are you thinking? We'll take you both to jail and charge you with conspiracy to pervert justice.
 Try and take me in, you won't make it to the end of the street.
 - Exactly what I said.
 - This is a lawful arrest.
 - If you resist, you will be shot.
 - I see.
 We all die together in a blaze of glory.
 If that's how it works out, that's fine.
 How about you, Harvey? - Fine by me.
 - Oh, God.
 I envy you boys.
 Having nothing to lose must be liberating.
 - Must feel pretty good.
 - Yes, it does.
 Suppose you did have something to lose.
 What would you do then? Suppose I had a knife to Barbara Kean's throat right now.
 Would you still be so brave? - You don't.
 - I'm telling you I do.
 You're a liar.
 I have many faults, but I'm not a liar.
 Victor Zsasz has Barbara.
 You know Victor.
 - You're lying.
 She's far away.
 - She came back.
 Came right to me to plead for your life.
 You have a good woman there.
 She loves you very much.
 Too much.
 Prove it.
 Prove you have her.
 I could.
 But I won't.
 I want you to believe me.
 It's obvious, Jim.
 He's lying.
 Am I? If you think so, go ahead and try to bring me in.
 You'll be dead, so you won't know what happens to Barbara.
 But it won't be pretty.
 Lying.
 On my mother's grave.
 Drop your gun and Barbara won't be harmed in any way.
 Those muffins smell good.
 None for you, creep.
 She can have one if she wants.
 No, thank you.
 Got it.
 What a shame.
 Oh, this is embarrassing.
 He straight-up bluffed you into folding.
 We could have gone out like heroes.
 Now we're fish food.
 Okay, so it wasn't a bluff.
 Sorry if she was mistreated a little.
 We needed to be sure she had nothing useful to tell us.
 Untie her, Victor.
 I'm sorry.
 It's okay.
 It's okay.
 What am I gonna do with you? By rights, you have to die.
 Whoa, hello.
 Um, late for work.
 Quite an adventure.
 I'll be on my way.
 Such a waste though.
 Gotham needs men like you.
 Both of you.
 Strong men with principles.
 I wish I could show you I'm not the enemy.
 The system is not the enemy.
 The enemy is anarchy.
 But I told you that before, didn't I, Jim? - Yes, you did.
 - You didn't listen though.
 Do we get a last meal or a smoke or anything? Or just talk? But today, you believed me.
 You trusted my word.
 That's a good first step.
 Perhaps there's still hope for you.
 Yes.
 Go.
 Get out of here before I change my mind.
 - Wait a minute.
 - Quiet.
 It's been a pleasure, Barbara.
 I do admire a brave woman.
 - What's the catch? - He said we could go.
 Let's not haggle here.
 What's the catch, Mr.
 Falcone? I want you to think about what I said.
 I want you to understand the truth.
 That's all I ask.
 The catch is someday soon, you'll see I'm right.
 Barbara.
 I'm sorry.
 I was just trying to help.
 And I don't know, I-- I love you so much.
 Mm.
 Excellent.
 Delicious.
 Yes.
 I followed the recipe.
 You're right, Mr.
 F.
 Cooking is easy.
 I'm sorry you had to see all that earlier.
 Not pleasant.
 I understand.
 Business is business.
 Yes, it is.
 I'll go see to the chickens.
 Bawk-bawk-bawk.
 Any eggs, my dears? Don Falcone.
 My friend.
 Good to see you.
 I was just thinking about the night we met.
 Cut them down.
 Where's the snitch? I wanna speak to him.
 Cobblepot, is it? Condemned men are honest men, I find.
 What can you tell me before you go? Don Falcone.
 It is a great honor, sir.
 Indeed, I can tell a secret of great value to you if you grant me one last request.
 Which is what? Give the job of killing me to James Gordon.
 Why him? He's the only man under your sway who has a conscience.
 The only one who might be persuaded to spare my life.
 Why would I agree to that? I want you dead.
 You're a snitch.
 If you agree and Gordon spares me then I will become your snitch for life.
 I will come back to Gotham under a different name.
 I will work my way into the Maroni family, and I will snitch for you.
 I'm excellent at this sort of work.
 I have a gift for it.
 I really do, sir.
 Deal.
 Gordon will get the job of killing you.
 Thank you, sir.
 What is the valuable secret? Oh, yes.
 Fish Mooney and Nikolai the Russian only pretend to hate each other.
 They're lovers.
 And Fish is pushing Nikolai to take your place.
 - Is that so? - Yes, sir.
 But only so Fish can take over from him.
 That is a good secret.
 It's almost uncanny.
 Everything played out exactly as you said it would.
 We got rid of Nikolai painlessly and Maroni thinks you're a wizard.
 You really do have a gift.
 But I think we're making a mistake letting Gordon live.
 He's trouble.
 Thank you so much for sparing him.
 I appreciate the favor.
 Don't worry.
 He'll see the light.
 One way or another, I guarantee it.
   

                



                


                    			Listen.
 - There are things I need to do.
 - If you stay, I stay.
 My name is Victor Zsasz.
 I'm here for Jim Gordon.
 Everybody out.
 There's not a single cop in the city who'll help you.
 I won't help you.
 I'm not leaving.
 You don't have to join me.
 I'm doomed anyhow.
 I might as well join the good guys.
 I ain't looking for no girl.
 I'm looking for a weapon.
 Excuse me.
 You want to start a war over this punk? The little guy amuses me.
 Why go to war over trifles? We'll let you have him.
 Our gift to you.
 Oh, God.
 Ugh.
 Hell of a way to start the day.
 - I mean, I just cleaned this.
 - Harvey.
 Hey.
 Uniforms found the body.
 No wallet, no ID, no watch.
 He got beaten up pretty good.
 I'm guessing the cause of death is that gigantic gash on the side of his neck.
 - You think? What's all the black on him? - Ink? Paint? - Mm.
 Good morning, Ed.
 - Detective.
 Going by overall coagulation, I'd say time of death is midnight.
 But he's only been here for a couple hours.
 Rats have just started on his ears.
 Sneaky little buggers.
 So not a mugging.
 Muggers don't move the body.
 Abrasions on his knuckles? Put up a fight.
 Yeah.
 Look at his suspenders.
 I'm guessing some kind of finance guy.
 Maybe it was an abduction-ransom thing gone wrong.
 He resists, ka-chunk! You wanna talk to the uniforms who found the body? Ah, you do it.
 We should canvass the area.
 A lot of homeless around here.
 - I'll get some unis on it.
 - I'll handle it myself.
 - Hey, Joe.
 Go smoke somewhere else, huh? - Come on.
 Jim, that's what we got uniforms for.
 Let them do it.
 - And I'd rather handle it myself.
 - Detectives.
 I'm guessing I should run all the prints.
 Yeah, Ed, run the prints.
 This one too? Yeah, Ed.
 That one too.
 It wasn't even a proper yacht.
 It was more like a dinghy.
 Can I help you? What a lovely brooch.
 Thank you.
 May I have it? Heh.
 I have a friend who would love that.
 Excuse me? I'm sorry.
 May I please have it? You shouldn't have.
 I wanted to make a gesture.
 I hope in time we can be friends.
 Friends? Hmm.
 Sure.
 Why not? What's done is done.
 I'm so glad you feel that way.
 Don Maroni wants us to clarify terms.
 Well, it's business as usual.
 Maroni still has his drugs, his unions.
 He pays tariff for the ports.
 If he needs favors from the cops or the mayor Don Falcone will consider it.
 And of course the families still share Arkham.
 And there's to be no blood spilled on either side.
 Not a drop.
 Mm.
 Maybe just a drop.
 Tsk-tsk-tsk.
 Look at you.
 Timothy do you know this fellow used to have your job? Carried my umbrella and thought it an honor.
 Now look at him.
 Has a seat at the table.
 Things change, eh? I've been blessed.
 Perhaps I should open your gift.
 My goodness.
 That is beautiful.
 Now I feel awful.
 - I didn't get you anything.
 - No.
 Thank you.
 Mm.
 - Sweet.
 - That was uncalled for.
 I brought you into my family and I treated you like a son.
 - And you betrayed me.
 - For which I suffered.
 Not enough.
 When I order some fool killed, I expect him to stay that way.
 - Your boss, Don Falcone, expressly said-- - Yeah, yeah.
 He wants peace.
 He's the only reason why your ass is still alive.
 And if I were you, I would pray for his good health.
 Oh, I do.
 I do.
 Good.
 Because remember things change.
 Convey my respects to your don.
 Likewise.
 Peace friend.
 Come now, Master Bruce.
 Had to happen sooner or later.
 Is this really necessary? Homeschooling is just as effective.
 I can show you the data.
 You need to be around children your own age.
 Why? - Because you do.
 - You know I despise that sort of answer.
 Don't you miss your mates? Not really.
 I've always found them kind of childish.
 That's what they're meant to be, aren't they? It's what they do.
 Don't you wanna be like a normal kid? I'm not sure.
 Define normal and make a good case for it.
 You're going to bloody school.
 Now, start walking.
 Good luck, lad.
 Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
 Can you think of anyone who'd wanna hurt your son, Coleman? No, sir.
 Nobody.
 He was a good boy.
 Yes, ma'am.
 I can see that.
 No arrests, an honest young man.
 - What did he do for a living? - He worked in a coffee shop.
 When we found him, he was in a suit.
 - Suspenders.
 - He was looking for a job in finance.
 He was very ambitious.
 First in our family to go to college.
 - Who would do this, sir? Why? - We'll do our best to find out, ma'am.
 Gordon's finishing up with the mother.
 Nothing off the severed thumb.
 None of the city's ERs have seen any thumb-less guys.
 - He went black market? That's next on my list.
 - How's Gordon? - Angry.
 How would you feel if every cop in the building ran out on you? Now they treat him like he's got the plague.
 Seeing him reminds them of what cowards they are.
 I'm sorry, cap.
 I didn't mean you.
 Nope.
 You're right.
 But he's gotta get over that.
 Can't do this job alone.
 Lucky he's got you.
 Yeah.
 So beautiful.
 As soon as I saw it, I thought of you.
 Such a good son.
 Put it on, put it on.
 Ah! What happened? Who did this? Nobody.
 It's just a scratch.
 Is your mother a fool? No.
 Someone is being mean to my boy.
 It's a tough business.
 The restaurant business is so tough these days.
 - Why is that? - My success makes people envious.
 So tell the boss on these people.
 This person isn't scared of the boss.
 Not like they should be.
 I don't know why.
 I know.
 When I was in school Magda Himmelfarb was so mean to me and teacher did nothing.
 Why? Because such a good dancer, I was.
 And Magda, with her nice hair and her big bosoms a cart horse! I meant why did the teacher do nothing? Why you think? Private lessons, they said.
 I put stop to that.
 You told on them.
 Oh, no.
 I denounced Magda's father to secret police.
 Ah! Three weeks he's been turning up his nose at my traps.
 And now, now today, a smidge of camembert and Mr.
 Rat, he cannot resist.
 No.
 Oh, can you? Can you, my little greedy baby? I found out your secret.
 Yes.
 Everybody has a secret.
 Morphine! Morphine! - They teach you that in med school? - Ugh.
 Bullock.
 Is that Kenny Suffield? Smash-and-grab guy.
 Also a real hound with the ladies.
 Who shot him? I don't ask.
 Me and my partner are doing all the rounds of you black-market sawbones.
 Guy we're looking for would've come in early this morning, missing a thumb.
 - Sorry.
 - You'd tell us if you knew, wouldn't you? I mean, that's the deal, right? You give us info, we let you keep operating.
 That's a pun.
 Operating.
 Bullock, black ink? Just like on the victim? Oh, doc Fine.
 He came in about 3 this morning.
 Didn't give a name but this dropped out of his pocket.
 - Sionis Investments.
 - What did he look like? Mid-20s, suit, suspenders.
 Just like our dead guy.
 Sorry, doc.
 This is Gordon.
 I need an ambulance and a black-and-white at 1856 Wilton-- Wait.
 Just a second.
 Just get me Alvarez, will you? Bullock.
 Bullock, what the hell, man? I got a deal with that guy.
 - Deal's off.
 - But I told you everything.
 - Yeah, after we caught you in a lie.
 - He always lies.
 You just squeeze him.
 - You're screwing the rest of us.
 - Yeah? - How's that feel? You like it? - Hey, enough! Enough! I get it, I get it, huh? Sons of bitches didn't have your back when it mattered.
 Where was I? I was there, remember? With Falcone and the mayor, blaze of glory? - Be nice for my sake.
 - I am being nice.
 Haven't you learned your lesson? We're only alive because Falcone let us live.
 - You gotta go along to get along, Jim.
 - No, I don't.
 You think locking up Doc Scumbag there is gonna make a difference? I'm on your side, I proved that.
 - Yeah, you did.
 - So I'm asking you, please let the doc out, and tomorrow you and I will go check out this Sionis Investments together.
 All right, partner? Sorry, Harv.
 - This ain't right, Harvey.
 - Alvarez, put a zipper on it! - Jim.
 - Barbara, what are you--? I heard someone come in.
 You didn't turn on the lights.
 - You got out my spare? - You were late.
 I got nervous.
 Not the best idea to be handling a firearm when you've been drinking.
 I'm sorry.
 Look you've been through a lot.
 It's over now.
 I am scared, Jim.
 Everywhere I go, I can I can feel that monster Zsasz stalking me, and I He's not a monster.
 He's just a man.
 I won't let anyone hurt you.
 How can you promise me that? Tell me it'll be okay.
 Tell me there really aren't any monsters.
 Or just lie, if you have to.
 There aren't any monsters.
 When are we gonna get out of here? That's up to you.
 Morning.
 Hi.
 I didn't think you were up.
 That last night was just nerves and way too much to drink.
 I said I wanted half your life, and I've got it.
 Leave the gun.
 I wish it wasn't like this.
 Do you really? Ignore me.
 I'm just tired.
 Go.
 Catch some bad guys.
 Go get them.
 Forensic examination by Edward Nygma.
 The room is approximately 19 degrees Celsius.
 I ate half a cranberry muffin earlier, saving the rest for later.
 What do a dead man, a cruise ship, and an emu have in common? Correct.
 Nothing.
 Ever more curious.
 He what? How many times have I told you to stay the hell out of here? But I discovered something-- You'll discover your butt on the street if you keep doing this.
 Out.
 Your loss.
 You sloppy ignoramus.
 Hi, Bruce.
 Hi.
 Brucey, how you doing? Tommy, hey.
 I'm well.
 How are you? You know, chilling.
 So your mom and dad got killed, huh? - Yes.
 - Did you see the whole thing? The blood and everything? - Rather not talk about that.
 - Just interested.
 Never seen a real dead body.
 Was there guts? I'll be going to class now.
 Forgive me, Mother, for I have sinned.
 Funny.
 Feels weird meeting here.
 You don't want anyone to see us together.
 Falcone has his eyes everywhere.
 So where are we? I cook for him.
 I sing to him.
 We go on walks.
 I don't know whether I'm his maid, his lover, or his mother.
 Or all three.
 He cares about you.
 - Yeah.
 - Hmm.
 Been inside his private office? Yeah, a few times.
 Inside the right bottom desk drawer is a ledger.
 Copy the last two pages.
 It'll be locked.
 You'll need a key off of his key ring.
 Heh.
 How do I get that? Behind you is a vial.
 Give it to him.
 He'll sleep like the dead for two hours.
 - It won't kill him, will it? - Mm.
 Liza, you haven't got feelings for the old man, have you? Not at all.
 No, it won't kill him.
 Killing him now would only create chaos.
 I need to siphon his strength.
 So when the time is right taking over his organization will be like slipping on a glove.
 What if one of his men catches me snooping? Then you're probably dead.
 You leave first.
 Something tells me we came to the right place.
 - You think? - Mr.
 Sionis will see you now.
 Ah.
 Richard Sionis.
 James Gordon.
 This is my partner, Harvey Bullock.
 How can I help you, detectives? I don't have much time.
 You know this man? Coleman Lawson? He might have interviewed for a job.
 Sorry.
 Any of your employees miss work yesterday? Any of them show up today with an injured right hand? I don't take roll call, detective.
 You mind if we check? Perhaps you can tell me what this is about.
 Coleman Lawson was killed two nights ago.
 The man who did it had your firm's card in his pocket.
 There's a thousand ways he could have gotten that.
 What's with all the warrior baloney? It inspires me.
 High finance is a tough business.
 In order to succeed, you have to be a warrior.
 No, you don't.
 You have to be a good businessman.
 Warriors fight wars.
 It's different.
 So you fancy yourself a killer.
 Have you killed people, Mr.
 Sionis? - Only metaphorically.
 - So all this is just juvenile play-acting.
 Exactly.
 Thus speaks a man who's seen actual combat.
 You've killed people for real, haven't you? True killers are easy to spot.
 Yes, they are.
 Why all the masks? A shrink would say you're hiding something.
 To the contrary.
 A mask hides the face, but frees the soul.
 A mask speaks the truth.
 Deep.
 How come so many of your employees have scars and injuries? Our touch football games get very rough.
 You're a liar, Mr.
 Sionis.
 Such fire.
 You must miss the battlefield desperately.
 I imagine killing gets quite addictive.
 You murdered Coleman Lawson, didn't you? Prove it.
 We will.
 I'd give you a good cop routine, but it's not in my tool kit.
 G.
C.
P.
D.
 Turn around slowly.
 Let me see those hands.
 Don't move.
 Should have waited for me.
 Hey, Brucey.
 It's Bruce.
 No Y.
 No parents either, so I can call you what I like.
 Please get out of my way.
 Snobby little jerk, isn't he? For an orphan.
 You're being very unkind.
 I don't understand why.
 Heh, boy, you're a weirdo.
 Your mother must have-- Don't talk about my mother.
 Oh, really? Oh, is that Timothy? We met at Fish Mooney's.
 Hmm? I'm the fellow who used to have your job.
 I was hoping to ask you a few questions.
 - I don't know anything-- - Shh.
 There'll be time for that.
 First things first.
 Most killers leave their prints at the crime scene.
 Not you.
 You left your whole thumb in the dead guy's mouth.
 You got style.
 I like you, kid.
 This is your last chance.
 Once we walk out that door, it's over.
 It was self-defense.
 Course it was.
 Wasn't that what I said, Jim? Didn't I say it was probably self-defense? Talk.
 Gordon's getting the rest of his statement.
 Apparently it was part of the hiring process.
 Sionis told the top three candidates to fight it out.
 They weren't supposed to fight to the death-- This is unbelievable.
 They signed confidentiality agreements.
 They're accomplices to whatever happens.
 - Do we know where the fight was? - Some old office building.
 He was taken there blindfolded.
 Yes, Ed.
 - Printer toner.
 - Do you know what he's talking about? The medical examiner's report said it was black ink but I did my own exam and it was printer toner.
 Also I pulled staples from his shoulders and found graphite chips between his ribs.
 He was killed in an office.
 Yeah, we're kind of past that, Ed.
 But thanks.
 Is there something else? Yes, it made me think of a case from a year ago.
 Young man, business suit.
 Esophagus lacerated from index cards shoved down his throat.
 So I did some digging.
 How many were killed with office supplies? Four.
 In the last three years.
 Get that man to sign a confession.
 Now.
 I think we have a problem.
 As counsel to Mr.
 Adams, I advised him against speaking further.
 Any statements he has made will be considered having been made under duress.
 Uh-huh.
 How much is Sionis paying him to take the fall? Good day.
 He showed up before Adams could sign his statement.
 Gotta figure out where Sionis is staging fights.
 I'll run all the buildings he or his company owns.
 - This make any sense to you? - No.
 But how is it any worse than the Goat or Balloon Man? When did this become normal for this city? What changed? Maybe nothing.
 It was always just below the surface, only needed a spark.
 What? Thomas and Martha Wayne being killed? I'm not blind, Gordon.
 I know you're still looking into it.
 But how could their deaths have caused all this? Why were they so important? I think it's what they represented.
 A different Gotham.
 Decent.
 Hopeful.
 Whatever it was, it's gone now.
 When Zsasz came for you, I should have stayed.
 I told you to go.
 That doesn't matter.
 I should have stayed.
 Let's get this guy.
 Yeah.
 Tad late, Master Bruce.
 Oi.
 - What happened? - I'm fine.
 What happened? Someone spoke disrespectfully about my mother.
 Oh, did they, now? I hope you broke their bastard teeth for them.
 No.
 He's much bigger than me, and I'm not good at fighting.
 Didn't hurt him at all.
 Not at all.
 Don't tell the school.
 Not bloody likely.
 Look at this.
 Sionis owns half of Gotham.
 We'll split up.
 Focus on the buildings that are abandoned or under construction.
 This son of a bitch is not getting away.
 I'll say one thing.
 He has your number.
 - What are you talking about? - Sionis.
 You may not have put down Cobblepot, but you've got a demon in you.
 You can call yourself a soldier but all this fighting Falcone, fighting other cops, you love it.
 So when you find something that seems remotely possible, call me.
 Barbara.
 Everything all right? Fine.
 I just, uh-- I wanted to check in.
 Can we talk later? In the middle of something.
 Of course.
 I love-- Hey.
 Boss wants his tea.
 It's almost ready.
 G.
C.
P.
D.
 Anybody else here? That would be a yes.
 Hey.
 Ah.
 Hi.
 Girl's gotta shop.
 This is your father's watch.
 Don't you lose it, now.
 Tommy Elliot's house.
 Don't you be scared.
 I'm not.
 I'm visualizing what I'm going to do.
 Because if you don't want to do this, there's no shame in it.
 There would be immense shame in it.
 - What the hell are you doing here? - We have unfinished business.
 Listen, if you think you're-- - Are you crazy? - Don't talk about my mother.
 - Unh! - Master Bruce! Point well made, I think.
 You all right, mate? Any broken bones? - He tried to kill me.
 - That's right.
 He did.
 He tried to kill you.
 Just you remember that next time you see him.
 And you remember that I let him try.
 Now, let's get some ice on those knuckles.
 What do you fancy for your dinner? - Pizza.
 - Pizza? Superb choice, Master Bruce.
 Jim, where the hell are you? My list crapped out.
 Call me.
 - Nygma, Gordon hasn't called in, has he? - No.
 But if the detective becomes the mystery, then Wake up.
 Detective Gordon.
 Wake up! So, three of you applied for a position at my firm.
 I explained then, you can use anything here as a weapon.
 The last man standing gets the job.
 However, tonight is special.
 You see the man without the mask? Whoever kills him is the victor.
 Listen to me.
 I'm a cop.
 So far none of you have broken any laws.
 Let the games begin.
 One last chance.
 Nobody move.
 Oh, and I'll throw in a million dollar signing bonus.
 Oh, crap.
 Alvarez, I need help checking these addresses.
 Gordon might be in trouble.
 - Busy.
 - I'll remember that next time your wife calls, asking where you are, you putz.
 Collins, listen up, man.
 Can I have some help? Now listen up, you sons of bitches! So you don't like Gordon.
 Fine.
 He can be a total ass hat, but he is still a cop.
 And not one of you, not one, stood up when he needed it.
 That ain't happening twice.
 I need help checking these addresses.
 Now.
 Give me a couple.
 - Okay.
 You'd cover with my wife, right? - Yeah.
 I knew you had a killer in you.
 So where are your brother police? Did they abandon you? I don't need them.
 Seems like I'll have to give myself the million dollars.
 Jim? Jim? Jim! Thanks.
 You're welcome.
 If I die and my soul be lost Ain't nobody's fault but mine Ain't nobody's fault but mine If I die and my soul be lost Ain't nobody's fault but mine You better have a good reason for being here.
 Did you get what I asked for? I want out.
 No.
 He's gonna find out.
 Maybe not today, but soon.
 Is it worth it? You are rich.
 People are afraid of you.
 Is that not enough? No.
 It's not.
 I grew up not too far from here.
 One bedroom, cold water, just me and my mama.
 I used to sleep in a bed behind a curtain.
 It's where I would hide when she entertained men.
 And that's where I was when he killed her.
 One of Falcone's men.
 They didn't like the service.
 I hid there, silent, until morning.
 With my mama two feet away from me.
 That night I made a promise.
 To get revenge.
 To never again be powerless.
 To never let any man any man be over me.
 This is about keeping that promise to that little girl.
 So, what's this about? This is a thread.
 I pull this and Falcone comes undone.
 You're scared.
 But I won't let anything happen to you, and that's a promise.
 I want you to say, I believe you, Mama.
 I believe you, Mama.
 That's my girl.
 The thing is, when I had your job had someone asked me what is Ms.
 Mooney's secret I could have answered.
 Ooh.
 Timothy.
 I think you're holding back on me.
 Okay.
 I-- I might have heard her with Butch.
 Talking about what? Whom? Fal-- Falcone.
 She said-- Our friend with Falcone.
 That's it.
 She was whispering.
 Please-- She has someone close to Falcone.
 Of course.
 Thank you.
 No one can find the body.
 - No.
 - We are at peace after all.
 No.
 No, please.
 No, no! Alvarez and Collins are bringing in Sionis' minions.
 Pansies tried to rabbit when they saw you cuffing their boss.
 You okay? Essen told me you made a speech.
 - I wouldn't call it a speech.
 - She said you called me an ass hat.
 I did call you that.
 Thank you.
 For having my back.
 Now and before.
 Just try not to be such a pain in the neck.
 Makes my day harder.
 You know, you were wrong.
 What you said earlier.
 It's not that I love fighting, but I'm not afraid to either.
 And if we don't fight for this city, who will? I'm not gonna stop, Harvey.
 Falcone, the mayor, every cop I know that's dirty I'm gonna get them.
 You should know that.
 Go home, Jim.
 You were listening tonight, weren't you? You gonna get in trouble, old woman.
 Heard you telling that girl stories.
 A lie with a heart of truth is a powerful thing.
 Go on.
 It's late.
 Hey, it's me.
 I'm coming home soon.
 Everything's gonna be better.
 I promise.
 I love you.
 Hey, Gordon.
 You got a minute? Can it wait? I'm on my way out of here.
 Some uni's brought in a perp.
 Claims to know you.
 - Oh, yeah? What's the charge? - B & E.
 Some fancy store uptown.
 Pretty professional job.
 Kid didn't even trip the alarm.
 Kid? A boy or a girl? Girl.
 Said to ask if you'd been down any sewers lately.
 Hey, detective.
 Miss me? I enjoyed it.
 I enjoyed hurting him.
 Of course you did.
 He deserved it.
 I'm so angry all the time.
 Will it ever go away? That I don't know.
 Alfred can you teach me how to fight? Yes Master Bruce.
 Yes, I can.
   

                



                


 Killing Falcone would only create chaos.
 I need to siphon his strength.
 So when the time is right, taking over his organization will be like slipping on a glove.
 I'm so angry all the time.
 Will it ever go away? Alfred, can you teach me how to fight? - You've been through a lot.
 - I'm scared, Jim.
 Everywhere I go, I can feel that monster Zsasz.
 Gordon, some unis brought in a perp.
 Claims to know you.
 Hey, detective.
 Miss me? Barbara? Whoa.
 Sweet crib.
 You must be one rich cop.
 - It's my girlfriend's place.
 - Where is she? I don't know.
 Barbara? So, what? I get to stay here alone? I'm hungry.
 Dear Jim, I thought I could be strong and brave for you, but I can't.
 Every place I go, I see Falcone and Zsasz.
 I'm nervous and needy and screwed up.
 I know that's not what you need or want.
 So I'm going away for a while to get myself together.
 This is Gordon.
 Oh.
 Uh, right, yeah.
 We're in the penthouse.
 Come on up.
 Sounds like your girlfriend's not coming back, huh? Why is she worried about Falcone? None of your business.
 What happens now? You gonna get the charges dropped? I will, but you're my only witness to the Wayne murders.
 You gonna cuff me to a drainpipe again? I'm not gonna hold you against your will.
 G.
C.
P.
D.
, juvie, you'd break out.
 So I do get to stay here.
 No.
 I have someplace else in mind.
 That's the sketch artist.
 I need you to describe the man who shot the Waynes.
 Wait, where am I going to stay? Wayne Manor.
 Don't speak to the inmate.
 Don't touch the inmate unless in service of your job.
 Don't accept anything from the inmate under any circumstances.
 Who is this guy, anyway? Ian Hargrove.
 Some genius bomb maker.
 Took out over a dozen buildings in Gotham.
 The one that blew up the commissary? Yeah.
 He did it with match shavings and apple cider vinegar.
 So no mistakes today, got it? Raise your hands up.
 She said this is the man who killed your parents.
 She said she saw his face.
 Do you recognize him, Bruce? No.
 What's her name? Selina Kyle.
 - Do you believe her? - Yes, I do.
 So she saw everything? And you want her to live here with us, do you? Common street criminal.
 She's hardly older than Bruce.
 She's just a kid who's seen too much.
 This is for her safety.
 G.
C.
P.
D.
 is full of moles.
 How long would you have us put her up, then? I don't know.
 No, the answer is no.
 Her being here will put Master Bruce in great danger.
 Alfred.
 She is the witness to a murder, Master Bruce.
 You do understand that, don't you? She's also the best chance we have at finding who killed my parents.
 Isn't she? Yes, she is.
 Then she can stay.
 As long as it takes.
 I've made my decision.
 Yes, Master Bruce.
 Look, I know this is a lot, but I'm doing everything I can.
 Montoya, Allen and I are meeting with an ADA they trust this afternoon.
 Oh, a trustworthy lawyer.
 In Gotham.
 Look, if we find this guy, we'll need her.
 She'll have to testify before a judge.
 Won't be easy.
 Witnesses back out all the time.
 The ones that stick it out do so because they care about the victims.
 We'll do our best to be nice to her, then, won't we? That's from the Chinese Ming Dynasty.
 Five.
 Five hundred years old.
 You can get one just like it for 5 bucks in Chinatown.
 I'm Bruce Wayne.
 Selina Kyle.
 People call me Cat.
 Nice to meet you, Cat.
 What are you doing? - Nothing.
 - What's in your hand? I said, what's in--? What the hell? Hargrove! Ian Hargrove, time to go.
 Kid, you screwed up, bigtime.
 But you're still young.
 You deserve a second chance.
 I have a bet for you.
 You call heads or tails.
 You lose, you go to jail.
 You win, we let you go.
 - Bet.
 - Hold on, there's a catch.
 You have to make a promise to God.
 If you win, you're gonna take this as a sign that you need to go back to school and get your life straight.
 Can you promise? - Do you promise that? - Yes, sir.
 Okay, then.
 - Call.
 - Heads.
 Walk away, kid.
 Somebody up there loves you.
 Hey, Harvey.
 Go.
 Remember your promise.
 Jim Gordon, G.
C.
P.
D.
 I hear good things about you, counselor.
 Harvey Dent.
 Likewise about you, detective.
 Was some trick with the coin.
 What if he guesses wrong? Gonna send him to jail? Teenagers, they nearly always call heads.
 Don't know why.
 Two-headed coin.
 Whatever works, right? So who is he, Jim? Who really killed the Waynes? Well, this is what we have.
 No ID.
 But this is from an eyewitness that you have in custody.
 It's not enough to go to the law with.
 Even if we had ID it's the people who hired him we want.
 I agree.
 Your eyewitness is useless in a courtroom.
 But the idea of your witness could be immensely valuable.
 Ever hear the name Dick Lovecraft? Sure.
 Billionaire.
 Property.
 Construction.
 Chemicals.
 As corrupt as they come.
 Falcone, Maroni, even Wayne Enterprises.
 Lovecraft has dealings with all of them.
 Since the Waynes' deaths, he's doubled his fortune, including a piece of the Arkham deal.
 Lovecraft had a long feud with Thomas Wayne over deals and politics.
 They couldn't have had a more different vision for Gotham.
 I'd bet my career on his involvement in the Wayne murders.
 That's a big bet.
 I want to use your witness to go after Lovecraft.
 How? My witness can't connect Lovecraft to the perp.
 Lovecraft doesn't know that.
 I'll let it leak out that we have a secret eyewitness who's going to blow the case wide open and connect Lovecraft to the Wayne killings.
 Lovecraft will get very nervous.
 The people around him will get nervous.
 And that's when people start talking.
 Unless Lovecraft wasn't involved.
 If so, which I doubt, we still win.
 Whoever was involved will get their cage rattled, won't they? - Bet he makes a move.
 - You like to bet a lot.
 What have we got to lose? - My witness becomes a target.
 - No.
 That's the beauty of it.
 We never file papers.
 We never name names.
 It's just a powerful story.
 Your witness is perfectly safe.
 You're on board with this? We've been on board, Jim.
 Harvey's one of us.
 I want what you want, Jim.
 I want to make this city a better place.
 No names.
 Not mine.
 Not my witness.
 Nothing.
 Just a story.
 Just a story.
 All right.
 Let's try something.
 Thought I was gonna have to work this without you.
 Where you been? You know what? On second thought, never mind, I don't want to know.
 - What we got? - A biggie.
 Blackgate prisoner escaped while in transit for psychiatric care.
 Name's Ian Hargrove.
 Clinically insane, with a compulsion for blowing things up.
 Exploded a bunch of old buildings around Gotham.
 Last one, two janitors were killed.
 Says here he was busted out by four gunmen.
 Yeah, which is odd.
 Hargrove never used accomplices.
 All right.
 Who did he spend time with at Blackgate? Who did he communicate with? His entire stretch he was isolated from gen pop.
 Never made or received calls.
 Only one visitor in two years, his brother, John.
 - Got an address? - We do.
 Unis are bringing him now for questioning.
 We're lucky you deigned to show up.
 - Yeah, sorry.
 - No problem.
 Girl trouble? Yeah.
 I told you, those high-society dames get you all twisted.
 Get your guard up.
 I'll knock lumps out of you.
 Watch your feet.
 Right.
 Jab, jab, right.
 Jab, jab, right.
 Keep that guard up.
 Jab, jab, right.
 Jab, jab, right.
 Yes.
 - Oy! - Sorry, Alfred.
 - Hello.
 - Bruce.
 - That hurt.
 - Yeah, it was supposed to.
 Taking a punch is just as important as throwing one, Master Bruce.
 - What you doing? - Alfred's teaching me to fight.
 - Why? - I'll be prepared if something bad happens.
 Yeah, because you live in a pretty rough neighborhood.
 Not here.
 In Gotham.
 In Gotham, people don't fight with gloves.
 How's your room? Good? It'll do.
 I'm hungry, though.
 Right.
 Well, breakfast was served at 8, which you slept through.
 - Lunch will be served at 12.
 - There's plenty in the kitchen.
 Alfred would be happy to fix-- No, he won't be, will he? He's not a bloody hotel.
 Relax, old man.
 I'll figure it out.
 You can mind your manners as well, you cheeky little minx.
 Be nice to her, Alfred.
 She's our guest.
 I'm terribly sorry, Master Bruce.
 Didn't realize you fancied her.
 What do you mean? No.
 It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
 It's only natural, isn't it? But you watch her.
 She's a lairy one.
 All right.
 Left, left, right.
 Keep your guard up, son.
 You know about girls, do you, Alfred? A sight more than you.
 And she, mate, is trouble.
 Oy.
 Oy, oy! Liza, Liza.
 What are you up to? Mm.
 Lilacs.
 I don't know anything about his escape.
 I haven't talked to him.
 Your baby brother busts out of prison and doesn't call you? The only person he's talked to in two years.
 What happened? - You two have a falling-out? - No.
 Ian and I are close.
 Always have been.
 Even after he bombed those janitors? That was an accident.
 - That's what they all say.
 - It's the truth.
 My brother's not a killer.
 He never was.
 He blew up 12 buildings in Gotham.
 Yes.
 Munitions factories and their offices.
 Places that made guns and bullets and missiles.
 I know he was wrong.
 But Ian thought that what he was doing was good.
 He didn't hurt a soul until the last bombing.
 He felt terrible about it.
 Practically handed himself in to the cops.
 And pleaded guilty.
 Ian has had mental problems since he was a kid.
 My parents didn't have money to get him help.
 He sure wasn't getting it at Blackgate.
 Look, my brother's not a bad man.
 Then what is he? He's sick.
 There's a difference.
 Okay.
 So who would want to bust him out? I don't know.
 But my brother needs help.
 You have to find him.
 It's done.
 I have a delivery for you.
 I'll take that.
 - Whoa.
 Who sent this, anyway? - Who cares? Mm.
 Wait a second.
 You hear that? Sounds like ticking.
 - Good morning.
 - Uh-huh.
 - How'd you sleep? - Your house makes noise.
 It's old.
 You didn't come here with much.
 If you want, Alfred can buy you some clothes.
 Pass.
 Detective Gordon told me you live on the streets.
 Yeah.
 So? - What's it like? - Not as nice as here.
 - Do you live alone? - You gonna ask me questions all morning? - Aren't you supposed to be in school? - I'm developing my own curriculum.
 It lets me move at my own speed and focus on areas that interest me.
 - Why? You're a billionaire.
 What's to learn? - That's a strange attitude.
 So where are your parents? They alive? Um Sure.
 They're around.
 - Where? - What's that to you? - Nothing.
 I just thought-- - Well, you thought wrong.
 I'm not an orphan.
 I got family all over.
 This was bad enough when it was a prison escape.
 Now we got five dead security guards, and the press is calling Hargrove a terrorist.
 Get anything from the bombing site? Forensics is looking into it, but the entire office was destroyed.
 - Including all security footage.
 - Yeah.
 We do know that Hargrove and his guys made off with a compound called HMX.
 It's military grade.
 Ten times more powerful than C4.
 - Nasty stuff.
 - Using explosives to steal explosives.
 What's that about? - Trading up? - Must be another target that's hard to crack.
 - You know what I'm gonna say.
 So go.
 Do it.
 This is Gordon.
 Yes, detective.
 It's Alfred.
 Alfred.
 ls everything all right? Selina okay? Well, she's safe.
 - But? - But I'm afraid this isn't going to work out.
 She's a tough nut, this one.
 Well, look, we need her help if we have any chance at catching the Waynes' killer.
 Hold on to her for now.
 I'll be out to check on her as soon as I can.
 We shall patiently await your arrival detective.
 - Everything good? - Right as rain.
 - Sure you want to go through with this? - Butch, don't go getting scared on me now.
 Never, boss.
 - Oswald, you're back.
 - Ha, ha.
 I'm starting to think you enjoy being hurt.
 I was passing by.
 Thought I'd say hello.
 Well, you've said it.
 Now, why are you here? Honestly, I'm just trying to be friendly.
 Mm.
 Lilacs.
 Mm.
 You smell good.
 You don't.
 Snappy as ever.
 Oh.
 Ha, ha.
 Well, goodbye, then.
 Sorry you're still grumpy with me.
 But you know, reaching out in friendship is never wrong.
 Man, that dude's creepy.
 Forget him.
 He's nothing.
 Hargrove's contacts and phone records from before Blackgate.
 Oh.
 - You all right? - Yeah.
 Barbara left.
 - Left left? - Yeah.
 - Where'd she go? - I don't know.
 It's a ploy.
 She wants you to set a date.
 It's a standard move.
 She'll be back.
 - Do you play video games? - Ed.
 Don't ever do that again.
 My apologies.
 Do either of you play video games? I do.
 I-- Ha, ha.
 I love video games.
 Each one presents a new challenge.
 A puzzle.
 A lot like detective work.
 - Ed.
 - Oh.
 Sorry.
 I had a chance to analyze the shrapnel from the securities office.
 I found something.
 It's a name plate.
 It was damaged, but you can still read the information.
 It's from an abandoned metal factory here in Gotham.
 That's really good work, Ed.
 Thanks.
 - Thank you, detective.
 - Let's go check this out.
 G.
C.
P.
D.
 Freeze! Don't shoot.
 - You found the name plate.
 Thank God.
 ls anyone else here? No, but they'll be back soon.
 Please help me.
 They broke me out.
 They kidnapped me.
 Said they'd kill my brother if I didn't help.
 - Who's they? - Russians.
 One of their names is Kasyanov.
 - Planning something against Falcone.
 - Falcone? Yeah, it's a big job.
 A vault.
 That's why they needed me to build explosives.
 What's this? Behind you.
 Get down! Get down! Keep them pinned down! - Get out of here.
 - Help me! Move, move.
 Come on.
 If you want to go somewhere, we can call you a taxi.
 - You move quiet.
 - So do you.
 Are you leaving? Thinking about it.
 I'm sorry if talking about your family upset you.
 I wasn't upset.
 You seemed kind of upset.
 That's your mom, huh? She looks nice.
 She was.
 You saw her.
 The night she was killed.
 Uh-huh.
 And you saw me? What I did.
 What I didn't do.
 What are you talking about? What could you have done? I don't know.
 Something.
 You're dreaming, kid.
 A gun's a gun.
 My mom's in show business.
 Oh? Yeah.
 She sings and dances and does magic tricks.
 Gets paid like millions.
 But that's just a cover.
 Really, she's a secret agent for the government.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 She's on a secret mission.
 But when she's done, she's coming back to get me.
 That's good.
 Yeah.
 Did you ever kiss a girl? No.
 Do you want to? Why do you ask? Just curious.
 Time for your studies, Master Bruce.
 Thank you, Alfred.
 You're more than welcome to join, Ms.
 Kyle.
 Right.
 I'll see you later.
 Do you have any idea how many angry phone calls we've been getting this week? - Got a terrorist out there.
 - That's our fault? Jim.
 No.
 Please.
 You tell me, detective.
 How is this my fault? For starters, you have the mentally ill housed at Blackgate.
 A prison with no facilities for them.
 You send them out for treatment.
 Which was exactly where Hargrove was headed when he was broken out.
 - I want him found.
 - Yes, sir.
 - Today.
 - Yes, sir.
 What is wrong with you? Hargrove's brother, John? I put him and his family in protective custody.
 That'll help.
 Only problem is, Hargrove doesn't know that.
 All right, Dent.
 You drag me down here.
 Now what? I got the last piece of the puzzle in place.
 I'm bringing charges against you.
 Oh, that old song again.
 You will never prove fraud.
 You know that, and I know that.
 Fraud charges are only part of it.
 Oh, really? What, then, jaywalking? Conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.
 Murder? So tell me, Dent.
 Who did I kill? Thomas and Martha Wayne.
 Oh, my God.
 I have an eyewitness who can tie you to the crime.
 You and all the others involved.
 It's absurd.
 Help yourself out here, Dick.
 Think about your options.
 This is going to get ugly.
 You're a fool.
 And you have no idea who or what you're even dealing with.
 Don't threaten me! I will rip you open.
 It's good to see you, Dick.
 - Jim.
 Got it.
 - Yeah.
 Meet Gregory Kasyanov.
 Long rap sheet.
 Worked for Nikolai before he died.
 - Who's he work for now? - Beats me.
 All right.
 Hargrove said it was a big job, a vault.
 Somebody's gotta be bankrolling it.
 Someone with cash and pull and beef with Falcone.
 Problem is, in Gotham, anyone with cash and pull has beef with Falcone.
 Hmm.
 So who is it? You kept me waiting.
 Ran into a little trouble.
 Nothing to worry about.
 Good.
 I've got a lot riding on this job.
 You've said.
 Your boss, Nikolai, is dead because of Falcone.
 You want to get back at him, you hit him where it hurts, his money.
 - Ain't that right, Butch? - Yup.
 The root of all evil.
 We'll take his money.
 No problem.
 As long as it's there, like you said.
 Oh, it's there.
 I'm positive.
 The truck you needed.
 And Gregor? Break a leg.
 You're the weirdest kid I've ever met.
 - Why are you doing that? - Training.
 Oh.
 Like the boxing.
 So if anyone mugs you with a diving board, you'll be ready? Huh? Yes.
 I mean no.
 - I'm developing self-discipline and willpower.
 - Why? So I can be strong.
 I get you.
 But it won't work.
 - Not on the streets.
 Not in Gotham.
 - Why's that? Out there on the streets, it's not enough to be strong.
 You gotta be mean.
 You gotta be ruthless.
 Know what ruthless means? - Of course I do.
 - Yeah? Well, you ain't.
 You're a nice kid.
 Five minutes on the street, you'll be mincemeat.
 And holding your breath won't do a damn thing.
 The subject for today's category is numbers.
 Here we go.
 How many bones in the human arm? Thirty-two.
 - Thirty-two.
 - Correct.
 Next, how many elements in the periodic table? One hundred eighteen.
 - Uh, 118.
 - Yes, again.
 Now for a tough one.
 How many eyes are there on cards in a deck? Forty-two.
 Twenty-one.
 No, sorry.
 The number you were looking for is 42.
 You forgot to double it for two eyes.
 Whoo! Ha, ha.
 That concludes our show for today.
 We'd like to thank all our contestants and those of you playing along at home.
 We'll be right back after this.
 Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 What about the explosives? It's a very specific type.
 It's highly volatile, and it's very difficult to manufacture.
 It's for one use, and one use only.
 - To penetrate iron.
 - Like a vault in a bank.
 Mm-mm.
 No, they're steel.
 No one makes anything out of iron anymore.
 Not for a hundred years.
 The Gotham Armory.
 Yeah.
 They have those iron vaults they used to keep the gunpowder in.
 A few years ago, a private investment group bought it.
 Ten to one Falcone's behind it.
 Mm-hm.
 Do you--? How much longer? It's ready.
 It didn't work.
 Hey, hey.
 Promise me nobody else is going to get hurt.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Sure.
 No problem.
 Cross my heart.
 You're surrounded.
 There's no way out.
 Drop your weapons! Don't do it.
 Get back.
 Hargrove! Ian Hargrove, your brother and his family are safe.
 We have them in protective custody.
 - If he runs, shoot him.
 - Don't shoot! - You shoot him, they shoot us.
 - Drop your weapons.
 Get away from the truck! Everybody down! Mm.
 - Why'd you do that? - Bet you can't hit me.
 I could.
 Why would I want to? - Try.
 - What for? Hit me, and hmm, I'll let you kiss me.
 Ha! - You didn't get me.
 - Oh, no.
 - Oh! - Ha-ha-ha.
 Stop it! No, hey--! - Morning, Alfred.
 - Detective.
 I've been trying to get out there.
 Sorry.
 Everything okay? - Is she behaving herself? - Well, not really, no.
 - It's all right.
 - It is? Yes, well, she's a breath of fresh air, I might say.
 Glad to hear it.
 I'll be out there as soon as I can.
 Very good, sir.
 Oh.
 Forgive me for the intrusion, but it's urgent I speak with you.
 You know who I am.
 Yeah.
 Falcone would kill you if he knew you were here.
 Perhaps.
 But what would he do if I told him you were spying on him for Fish Mooney? You don't have any proof.
 No.
 But suspicion, it's a funny thing.
 Heh.
 Falcone might not choose to believe me at first, but every time he looked at you he'd ask himself, Is she? Could she? Would she? You're wrong.
 He cares about me.
 Let's call him and find out, shall we? Stop! Your secret is safe with me.
 I won't tell because you are going to keep working for Fish.
 And you are not gonna tell anyone, or you'll die.
 Messages for Gordon? Thanks.
 - Jim, you have a minute? - Uh, yeah.
 - I met with Lovecraft.
 - How'd it go? He was scared.
 He's involved, all right.
 - Scared isn't proof.
 - You didn't see him.
 Told the same story in a few other spots.
 All the players know.
 Someone will talk.
 If and when they do, no one makes a move without talking first.
 Move together on this.
 Absolutely.
 Nice work on the Hargrove case.
 You saved his life.
 You're a regular saint.
 - Thanks.
 We'll talk again soon, I hope? - You bet.
 Thanks, counselor.
 - Finish up with Hargrove? - Yeah.
 - He's on his way to Arkham.
 - Arkham? Mayor's directive.
 He's taking all the criminally insane inmates and sending them to Arkham for appropriate treatment.
 That's nuts.
 The building's 200 years old.
 Welcome to Gotham.
 Oh.
 Hargrove said the bomb that blew up the money wasn't his.
 - Whose was it? - He didn't know.
 How did it go? Cops were everywhere.
 My guys had no way out.
 - Had to make the call.
 - Is everybody dead? Gregor? All his men? Every last one.
 Good.
 I can't stand loose strings.
 You're not mad? That's a hell of a lot of money we lost.
 Mad? I couldn't be happier.
 The point wasn't to steal that money.
 It was to hurt Falcone.
 Well, that you did, Fish.
 That you did.
 Good afternoon.
 Thank you all for coming.
 As you know, the people of Gotham have been shaken by tragedy in recent days.
 Tragedy no citizen should have to endure.
 What has happened these past few days is a result of Gotham's criminally insane not getting the appropriate treatment and help that we owe them.
 That is why I am moving forward with plans to turn the renovated Arkham Asylum into a remedial facility for the criminally insane.
 Barbara, it's me.
 I got your letter, and I, um know you said you needed some time away from Gotham.
 From me.
 But I want you to come back.
 I need you to come back.
 I don't have anything without you.
 And I love you.
   

                



                


                    			- Last season on Gotham - It's in here.
 It's in this room.
 My father's secret, it's in this room.
 Going after Loeb is suicide, plain and simple.
 As usual, wrong place, wrong time.
 You're a disgrace, Loeb.
 What's black and white and red all over? Stop talking like that.
 Why did you kill your mother, Jerome? Barbara, Jason Lennon killed your parents.
 - You didn't kill them.
 - Yes, I did.
 Good-bye, Fish! I'm the king of Gotham! What is it, do you think? Bloody hell.
 No, wait, wait, wait! There must be a million possible combinations, Master Bruce.
 - Drink it all.
 - Thank you, Master.
 Now go.
 Come on through.
 Let's go, let's go.
 I am Zaardon Shut up! The Soul Reaper! Foolish slaves! You cannot escape me! Sir, drop the guns! You! You! Hey! Come on! Your primitive weapons cannot hurt me! Prepare to die, insect.
 Hey listen, I don't want to shoot you, man, all right? Too much paperwork.
 So why don't you just put the sword down.
 Stay down.
 Relax.
 Yo, Gordon.
 What's up? Busy shift? You're late.
 Geez, relax, will ya? What's the matter with you, man? Hey! Bad idea.
 How can this be? Zaardon drank dragon's blood from the master's chalice.
 Zar-don that spelled how it sounds? Two A's.
 Close enough.
 You dare send me to prison? Oh, no you're a cinch for Arkham.
 Hear me, Gor-Don.
 You might have won this battle, but the war has just begun.
 The master will unleash hell upon you.
 Dark days are coming.
 Thanks for the heads-up.
 Ed.
 - You okay? - Never better.
 Officer Gordon 23611, report to the captain's office immediately.
 I'm up.
 See ya.
 He's gone.
 Relax.
 Holy moly, look at you! Everyone's gonna think you're going nuts.
 I get nervous when you talk to me with other people around like that.
 Stop doing that.
 - What? - That! Copying me.
 Dude it's a mirror, that's how they work.
 You know what I think we need? I think that we need a little more fun.
 Some romance.
 Stop.
 I know where this is going.
 I told you, leave Miss Kringle alone.
 Imagine her in our arms.
 Those big eyes looking up at us, and soft trembling flesh.
 Be quiet! It's a simple question, Officer Gordon Did you or did you not put your hands on Officer Franks here? - Yes.
 I did.
 - Mm-hmm.
 From the first day on the job, you've been an insubordinate troublemaker.
 I hoped demotion to uniform duty would suffice to make you quit.
 It worked for your partner, Bullock.
 However, you've now confessed to violation of section 12.
 Immediate dismissal is mandatory.
 Commissioner, this is not just.
 Officer Frank sustained no harm, and Officer Gordon showed admirable restraint in defusing a dangerous hostage situation.
 Thank you so much for your input, Captain.
 The facts speak for themselves.
 The facts say he deserves commendation, not dismissal.
 You're letting gutter politics That's enough, young lady.
 Take Officer Mister Gordon's badge and gun.
 That's an order.
 All good.
 Let it go.
 Thanks, though.
 It's been an honor working for you.
 This is all for the best, you know.
 Some men are just not meant to be cops.
 I told you I'd break you.
 I will.
 What did you say to Loeb? Did you get mad? Well, I disagreed with his decision.
 Come on.
 You know I need the details.
 I said I'd break him.
 Words to that effect.
 Hey, you went out with a bang.
 Maybe it's for the best.
 That's what Loeb said.
 I should have walked away.
 I just hate to quit.
 You didn't quit.
 You were fired.
 What can you do? Oh, there's things I can do.
 I thought you said you didn't have any legal moves left.
 I don't.
 You want to be a cop so bad, you're willing to break the law? I'm willing to bend it a little, yeah.
 You're happy I got fired, huh? You got me.
 But only because I know that you'll never quit.
 And I love that about you.
 But they have you directing traffic, Jim.
 Why keep beating your head against a wall.
 I'm a cop, Lee.
 I'm a cop.
 Hi, gorgeous.
 I'm Jerome.
 Keep moving, ginger.
 Just being polite.
 So, what-cha in for? Killing my parents.
 Oh.
 Me, too.
 Well Mom, anyhow.
 Liberating, right? Oh what a rush! Yeah, all righty, then.
 You see the big handsome fella staring at you like you're fried chicken? Richard Sionis.
 He's a millionaire.
 Mm, got his own airplane.
 Got a boat with a hot tub on it.
 And he killed 25 people just for fun.
 - So what? - So he likes you.
 He wants to be your friend.
 Hmm.
 Let me think.
 No.
 A girl needs a good friend in here.
 See, the guards, they don't care.
 They figure bad things happen to bad people.
 And they happen all the time.
 All the time.
 Hey, you.
 Hello? Baldy! Here, here.
 Hello, yes.
 Hi.
 Come here.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 My name is Barbara.
 - Would you be my friend? - Yes.
 Hey, if someone here tries to hurt me - would you protect me? - Yes.
 Thank you so much.
 Cutie.
 Now I have a friend.
 You're bad.
 Yeah, so why don't you go make me a sandwich.
 Your friend is a gorilla.
 My friend runs the joint.
 And he can get you things that other people can't get you.
 - Things like what? - Anything you need.
 I need a telephone.
 Ogden Barker, in for 70 grand, plus two months vig, Says he owes Falcone.
 Falcone's gone, so his debt's forfeit.
 Well, we can't have him saying that.
 What if everybody started saying that? There'd be anarchy.
 What is it? Oh.
 Splendid.
 Jim! Come on in! My dear old friend.
 We need to talk.
 Oh.
 Leave us.
 Hey, Selina.
 - Moving on up, huh? - Tryin'.
 Isn't she darling? It's like having a cat around the house.
 But no horrid dead mice.
 I need a favor.
 I figure you owe me one.
 I do? I'm always happy to help you, Jim, but I-I, I don't recall The hospital.
 I saved you from Maroni's men.
 But I was only there because you arrested me.
 For attempted murder.
 Remind me again why I let you go.
 Enlightened friendship.
 I'd call us even, but let's not quibble.
 I'm so happy you came to me for help, Jim.
 The answer is yes.
 Your wish is granted.
 You don't know what it is yet.
 You want Loeb fired, and your old job back, no? Yes.
 For a good friend like you, it can be done.
 If you're sure that's what you want.
 I'm sure.
 May I ask why? Police work in Gotham is such a thankless job.
 - Good pension.
 - What does Lee think? Who? Are you gonna help me or not? Relax.
 I already said I would help.
 He is so brusque, isn't he? No, thank you.
 Oh while I think on it, perhaps there's a small favor you could do for me in return.
 I know how you hate to owe favors.
 I am having a small business dispute with a friend of mine.
 Ogden Barker.
 You have a persuasive personality.
 Perhaps you could talk to him.
 You want me to collect a debt for you? I want you to prove to me that our friendship is a real one, based on trust and equity.
 That's fair.
 No.
 Sorry.
 Can't help you.
 Congratulations on all your success.
 - Be good, Selina.
 - Always.
 Don't say no now, Jim.
 Sleep on it.
 Screw Penguin, screw the GCPD, and screw this city.
 Amen.
 You're doing the right thing, brother.
 Walk away, Jim, just walk away.
 You'd do the same thing, right? Me? I'd serve a sandwich to Beelzebub, but that's just me.
 You are a moralist.
 You could never work for Penguin.
 The shame would eat away at your guts.
 Yeah Yeah.
 - Ooh, slow down, slurpy.
 - Mm You're not joining me? I've been sober 32 days.
 Eh, it's no biggie.
 Once I quit the job, quitting drinking was easy.
 It's the job, Jim.
 Makes us angry.
 Makes us hard.
 Yeah, it does.
 It's hard to walk away, but it can be done.
 I just couldn't carry that badge anymore.
 Look at me now.
 Right? I'm sober I have a woman who does not dislike me, I live in a house, I sleep at night.
 I've never been happier in my life.
 Here's to civilian life.
 I'm proud of you, brother.
 Got to go.
 I really am most frightfully sorry it took so long to answer the door, sir.
 Strange.
 Normally a buzzer sounds when a car comes through the gates.
 I walked.
 You two are dirty.
 What have you been doing? I imagine you have something important to say.
 Yes.
 I've been fired from the GCPD.
 I won't be able to keep the promise I made you.
 I wanted to apologize.
 Your apology's accepted, of course, but you didn't need to walk here.
 A phone call would've been fine.
 - I needed the air.
 - No hope - for reinstatement then, sir? - No.
 Well, there is a way, but it's too ugly.
 I would have to collect a debt for Penguin.
 To prove our friendship.
 Ah.
 And you can't do that, because he's a bad man.
 And the task would be demeaning.
 Well, yes.
 You were going to find my parents' killers.
 You were going to fight for justice.
 You were going to clean up the GCPD.
 Change Gotham.
 I had hoped to do that.
 If you remained at the GCPD, you might still be able to do all those good things, but first you must do something ugly.
 And your personal honor forbids that.
 Yes.
 Are you not sacrificing the greater good for the sake of your dignity and self-esteem? - For vanity? - Steady on, now, Master Bruce.
 Manners.
 He walked all the way here to discuss the issue, Alfred.
 I'm simply asking a question.
 Surely, sometimes, the right way is also the ugly way.
 Sometimes a man can't take the right way.
 He's dealing with all kinds of business you can't possibly understand yet, because you're still a child.
 Yes, Alfred, there is still a great deal I don't understand yet.
 Please forgive me if I've offended you, Jim.
 No, no.
 That's okay.
 I'll show you out, sir.
 Screw it.
 Ooh! Jerome says you can get me a telephone.
 I try and help my friends.
 What do your friends do for you? Well, that depends on how much you want a telephone.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Hold it right there.
 Ogden Barker.
 Penguin asked me to talk to you.
 Damn, boy.
 You had me worried there for a minute.
 I know you.
 You're Jim Gordon.
 Cop.
 Supposed to be a cold stone hard-ass.
 But you're Penguin's bitch, huh? Who the dickens can you trust anymore? He wants his money.
 How many times I got to tell you people? No.
 To Don Falcone, I'll pay.
 To that fruitcake leprechaun? Nish.
 Not a penny.
 Falcone's retired.
 Times change.
 Penguin's boss now.
 Like hell.
 The freak won't last the year.
 Don't underestimate him.
 Advice now.
 I'm trying to be nice here.
 Let's work this out.
 Yeah? Let's not.
 Walk away.
 Walk away before I kick your ass, you crooked punk bitch.
 How much money you got there? - Looks like a lot.
 - What is your problem? I don't have a problem.
 Give me the money you owe.
 How about I put a hole in your face? I'm gonna count to three.
 You're crazy.
 One Put the money in the bag.
 Do it! Oh-ho-ho, get him, man.
 Stop! Thief! Out of the way.
 Hey, cop Fertilizer? What is your game? I would've thought that's obvious to a man of your perception.
 It occurred to me to follow my own advice.
 Sometimes the ugly way is also the right way.
 I mean, a bomb, inside the house? I mean, you're having a laugh, ain't ya? A bomb? I was going to tell you.
 I wanted to present it as a fait accompli.
 Don't start talking French to me.
 You don't know the first thing about bomb-making anyway, do you? I read a book, Alfred It seems simple enough.
 A book.
 I mean, you're gonna blow your bloody head off before you put a dent in that thing.
 You know, maybe that door's trying to tell us something.
 Maybe you're not ready to find out what's behind it.
 Maybe we should wait until you're older.
 I mean, who knows what your dear old dad was up to down there, anyway.
 Like what? Like things I wouldn't want to describe to a child, which is exactly what you are.
 I'm building a bomb to blow down that door.
 You may assist me or not, as you wish.
 But i-if not, some tea would be nice.
 Right, well, you're gonna need ten more sacks of that gear, for starters; three more dairy cans, too; and extra timber; a heavy tarpaulin.
 And I'll put the kettle on.
 Excellent.
 Excellent.
 I'm so sorry things got messy.
 What a foolish fellow.
 Never mind.
 I will make sure that there's no follow-up from your colleagues.
 Don't worry about a thing.
 You knew.
 You knew Ogden would go off.
 What a devious mind you have.
 I had no idea.
 We have a deal.
 We do.
 We do.
 You okay, Jim? Oh, yeah.
 Daydreaming.
 What's wrong? Nothing.
 Hello.
 Hello? Jim? Hello? Are you still there? I'm here.
 Hi.
 How are you? How did you get to a phone? Who cares? We're talking at last That's the important thing.
 What do you want? Jim, there's been a terrible mistake.
 I never told Lee that I killed my mom and dad.
 And I never attacked her.
 She attacked me, Jim.
 She's completely insane! That's enough.
 Don't call again.
 Who was that? Sales call.
 - They can drive you crazy, huh? - Sales call? Don't.
 Wh-What? Don't answer it.
 - Jim, you're scaring me - It's Barbara.
 Go ahead and leave a message.
 Hey, girlfriend.
 Guess who.
 Sorry I missed you.
 Bummer, eh? I just wanted to say that I hope you die screaming, bitch.
 Bye.
 Nice.
 All right, look she's safely locked up at Arkham.
 - She can't hurt you.
 - I know, I know.
 She's just a sick person spreading sadness.
 Screw her.
 Let's be happy.
 Let's go away someplace.
 We can't let a crazy woman drive us out.
 Why not? Pride? Who cares? We could go away and never come back.
 What's keeping us here? I can't leave.
 Why not? Jim I did a bad thing.
 I did a bad thing.
 Hi.
 Do you have any peanut butter? What?! Peanut butter.
 Smooth, for preference.
 Guards, help! Help! Oh, hi, boss.
 How about a bottle of beer? Let me share a dilemma with you.
 May I? I need you to do something for me that I know you won't want to do.
 What is it? With most people, there's no problem.
 I find their weak spots and use violence or blackmail to persuade them.
 But you you are a man of monkish virtue.
 You have no vices to expose.
 So threats of personal violence will only harden your resolve, huh? No, that Come, sir, don't be modest.
 You are a rare animal.
 But that does lead us to this sad pickle.
 Since I can't persuade you to do as I ask, the only rational option is to kill you and negotiate with whomever replaces you as commissioner.
 Now, chief? One moment, Victor.
 The commissioner deserves time to process all this say a prayer or what have you.
 What do you want me to do? It's not worth talking about.
 - You wouldn't do it.
 - Tell me.
 I need my friend Jim Gordon reinstated as a detective.
 See? You hate that idea.
 No, I'll I'll do it.
 Mm-mm, I can tell that you're not sincere.
 Even if you do as I ask, someday, down the line, you'll change your mind, and you'll turn on him again.
 Want me to kill him now? No, make him a nice cheese toastie.
 Yes, kill him now, please.
 Just wanted to be clear.
 No, wait! Let's talk about this.
 Sorry.
 Least worst option.
 Unless of course uh - No, you would never agree.
 - To what? Agree to what?! Lovely, lovely, bravo.
 Mayor James regrets he's unable to attend today, but he's sent a dear friend in his stead.
 Please welcome distinguished businessman, visionary scientist, acclaimed philanthropist and new chairman of development at the Gotham Chamber of Commerce, Mr.
 Theo Galavan.
 Thank you so much.
 Uh What an honor it is to be here today, to help bid farewell to a great man and a faithful servant of this city.
 What can I say about Gillian Loeb? Someone tell me a funny story.
 I have a good one.
 So when I was in college, I played for the varsity polo team and I had a a string of ponies.
 Greetings! I am Zaardon, the Soul Reaper.
 So I had these ponies I'm an adopted son of this city.
 I haven't lived in Gotham very long, but I already love her like a native.
 It just it just kind of grabs hold of you, doesn't it? There's magic here.
 Magic.
 And that is down to everyday heroes like Gillian Loeb.
 Mr.
 Commissioner, thank you for your service.
 Thank you very much, everybody.
 My best wishes to Commissioner Essen.
 And the maÃ®tre d' says, You can't bring them in here.
 Hear me, slaves.
 My patience is wearing thin.
 Surrender your souls to my mercy, or I swear by the master, I shall feast on your pain.
 I shall gorge on your torment.
 I shall crush you like a bug.
 Backup to area five! Area five! Welcome back, Jim.
 I don't know how you pulled this off, but I'm glad you did.
 He's a resourceful man.
 Congratulations, to both of you.
 Thank you.
 And it is a new day, Jim.
 - We're going to do great things.
 - Yes, we are.
 It is a new day.
 Things are gonna be all right.
 I promise.
 - I hope it was worth it.
 - I hope so, too.
 Jim What's wrong? There's been an incident.
 At Arkham Asylum.
 Six inmates have escaped.
 - Barbara Kean was one of them.
 - Oh, my God.
 What the hell is this place? Ain't Arkham, anyhow.
 Things are looking up.
 Welcome, everyone.
 My name is Theo Galavan.
 This is my sister Tabitha.
 Oh, my God, look at that.
 Yeah, I got to get my hands on that.
 I understand You're feeling confused, scared a little groggy but please, relax.
 Today is the first day of a wonderful future for all of you.
 - If you want it.
 - Who are you? Well, now, the question is who are you? The world sees criminal lunatics.
 I see brilliance.
 I see charisma.
 And power.
 I see power.
 Yes.
 Exactly, my man.
 Oh, that is so spooky.
 That is me to a T.
 These other bozos, oh, I don't know, but - you're singing my song.
 - Quiet, Jerome.
 Keep talking.
 Imagine a group of brilliant outlaws like yourselves, each selected for their unique ability, all working together as a team.
 Imagine the synergy.
 Imagine the impact.
 Gotham would tremble before you.
 Well, that sounds fabulous, but I am not a brilliant outlaw.
 I just have mm issues.
 You have ferocity and beauty and desire and that's enough.
 Come with me, Barbara.
 Whatever you want in the world, it's yours.
 Theo? That's your name, right Theo? You're getting way ahead of yourself, here.
 First of all, keep your hands off her.
 Second, this whole magic team? I gotta pass.
 I don't take orders.
 Good luck on everything, though.
 It's an intriguing concept.
 This is very disappointing.
 Oh.
 Fair play.
 You want a reward for busting us out of Arkham.
 I am grateful.
 How's a million bucks sound? Pretty good, huh? I can get it for you today, as soon as I hit the street.
 Money's not the concern.
 Oh I had such high hopes for you.
 I didn't anticipate sexual jealousy.
 That always poisons the well.
 You have to go.
 Tabitha will see you out.
 Miss Kean is coming with me.
 Oh, she doesn't want to go where you're going.
 Anyone else want to leave? You're absolutely sure about this, Master Bruce? - I strongly advise - Alfred.
 I need to know.
 Let's do this.
 - Yes, we're in! - Yes, yes! Dear Bruce, these last weeks I begin to feel very mortal, which prompts this note to you.
 Perhaps I'm being paranoid.
 I hope so.
 In any case, if you're reading this, then I'm dead, and you figured out that the entry code is BRUCE.
 I'm sorry I had to hide this part of my life from you, because this place only exists because of you.
 Becoming a father made me want to be a better man, and I started asking hard questions about the family business.
 So here we are.
 As I write this, you're 12 and a fine, good-hearted boy.
 So I'm sure you'll be a fine, good-hearted man.
 But that's all I know.
 I don't know what happened to me or your mother, or how life has turned out for you.
 I don't even know how old you are.
 So I'll resist giving you much fatherly advice.
 You can't have both happiness and the truth.
 You have to choose.
 I beg of you, my son, please choose happiness.
 Unless Unless you feel a calling.
 A true calling.
   

                



                


 My best wishes to Commissioner Essen.
 Welcome back, Jim.
 I don't know how you pulled this off, but I'm glad you did.
 Sometimes the right way is also the ugly way.
 There's been an incident at Arkham Asylum.
 Six inmates have escaped.
 Barbara Kean was one of them.
 Oh, my God.
 The world sees criminal lunatics.
 I see brilliance.
 Gotham will tremble before you.
 I beg of you, my son, please choose happiness.
 Unless you feel a calling.
 A true calling.
 Mr.
 Yes, sir.
 Shall I tell you? Please, please.
  At heart I'm an ardent student of human nature.
 Fascinating paradox, we are.
 So wise, and yet so foolish.
 So brave, and yet so fearful.
 For instance, this is a glass jar.
 Inside of it is a hairy spider.
 - A tarantula, I guess, but I'm no expert.
 -  In a minute, I'm gonna open that little hatch in the front of your box, I'm gonna drop the spider inside, and I'm gonna close it.
  That's choice A.
 I open the hatch, you speak to your lovely secretary Maggie on the telephone, you tell her you've run away with some woman, you'll be sending written instructions shortly.
 So which is it, choice A or choice B? Choice B, please.
 Please, choice B.
 The telephone.
 Of course.
 It's human nature.
 See? There is no spider.
 But if you don't do what I ask, you'll wish there was one.
 Why are you doing this to me? Don't fret so.
 You're part of a great endeavor.
 A great cleansing.
 Monsters are coming, Mr.
 Mayor.
 Monsters.
 Who will cleanse this city in blood and fire.
  What the hell is this?  Where is Mayor James? Who is his mystery lover? No one cares - who the mayor is banging! -  You can do better than this, people.
 Now go out and get me some headlines, damn it!   Yeah.
 All right, all right.
 Oh, my God.
  -  - Perfect.
 Next.
 Mr.
 X.
    Uh, a little to the right.
 Okay, that's the spot.
    Perfect.
 What shall we do with the spare? Ooh! I know.
  Aaron.
 Would you kindly?   Maniax!  Now that's a headline.
  You all know what we're facing here.
 were busted out of Arkham Asylum.
 Yesterday, four of those inmates broke into Yellen Shipyard, kidnapped seven workers, then dropped them off the roof of the Gotham Gazette.
 As of now, we still have no leads on the person or persons behind the breakout.
 Jim Gordon's lead.
 Jim.
 These are our targets.
 Jerome Valeska, 18 years old.
 Matricide.
 Arnold Dobkins, schizophrenic.
 Poisoner, rapist.
 Aaron Helzinger.
 Killed his entire family with his bare hands.
 Robert Greenwood.
 Killed and then ate a dozen women.
 Barbara Kean.
 Killed her parents.
 We're gonna work this in groups of four.
 I'll hand out assignments throughout the day.
 Alvarez is my coordinating officer.
 Any questions? Let's get to work.
 Fine job yesterday, gentlemen.
 We opened big.
 The whole city knows your name now.
 So, bravo.
 Let's give ourselves a round of applause.
 Now that we have Gotham's attention, it's time for the Maniax to make a grand entrance.
 Wasn't that it? That was the overture.
 Now the audience is hushed, expectant.
 The curtain rises Then what happens? Oh, then we confront Gothamites with their most primal fears.
 Take from them all they hold dear and sacred.
 And then what happens? Why, then, we offer them salvation.
 And then they are ours.
 Let's get busy, man.
 Patience.
 First, you gentlemen need to learn a little stagecraft.
 Stagecraft? You're going to be on TV.
 You have to present yourselves with style and vigor.
 Dobkins, say Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
 Again, with a smile.
 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
  You.
  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Not bad.
 Sinister and authoritative.
 Never mind.
 Jerome.
  Ladies and gentlemen, good evening! Very good.
 Boyishly charming.
  The laugh is fabulous.
 - Use that.
 Now me.
 Ow! I am so glad that you two are getting along, but we're a little busy here, so if you could leave the poor mayor alone We're bored.
 Yeah.
 Why do the boys get to have all the fun? Your time is coming.
 I told you.
 You haven't killed him, have you? No, I don't think so.
  Nope.
 Hanging in there.
 When? When is my time coming? Soon.
 Very soon.
 Why don't you tell me about James Gordon.
 What do you want to know? It's hard to believe.
 My father's been sneaking down here for years, and I never even knew about it.
 That makes two of us, doesn't it? Wait.
 Let's just think about this.
 Are you certain you want to turn that bloody thing on? Of course I'm certain.
 Have you thought it through, Master Bruce? This computer could contain all my father's research into Wayne Enterprises.
 All this time, I've been looking for a smoking gun, and here it is.
 Exactly.
 A smoking gun.
 Now, guns are for grown-ups, aren't they? That's a metaphor, Alfred, not an argument.
  Here it is.
 It's working! What are you What are you doing?! Alfred, stop! What are you doing?! No, what are you doing, Alfred?! Alfred, stop it! It's ruined! It's ruined! What's wrong with you?! Why would you do that?! Answer me! It had to be done, Master Bruce! This was the key to exposing Wayne Enterprises.
 Everything that I've worked for, everything my everything my dad worked for is now gone! Because of you! If I'd known what was down here, I would have never helped get you in.
 I mean, look around you.
 Look, look.
 Liters of blood.
 A bulletproof vest with two slugs in it! Guns, weapons! I mean, whatever's on that computer probably killed your father, and I'll be damned if I see you suffer the same fate, Master Bruce.
  I'm trying to protect you.
  I'm trying to keep you safe.
 I want you to go.
 - Look, I know that you're - No.
 - that you're upset, you - Alfred.
 I want you to go and never come back, do you understand me? You're fired.
 Very well, Master Bruce.
 As you wish.
  Ooh! Shiny.
  Give that back.
 I saw it first.
 No, you didn't.
 I said give it back.
 Make me, you little brat.
 Ooh.
 Ooh.
 Your samurai skills are excellent Greenwood San, but they are nothing compared to me.
  Prepare to die! Rum, rum, rum!  That's enough! That's good.
 I tried to stop them.
 Boys, we're a team.
 We don't fight amongst ourselves.
 Yeah, we're a team, boys.
 And I'm the captain.
 Captain of my foot.
 I've murdered a dozen women.
 Terrorized the city.
 What have you done? Chop up your mommy? Everybody has to start somewhere.
 See, I have vision and ambition and brains.
 You're just a nutty old cannibal.
 How many people can you eat before that shtick gets old? I could eat one more.
 I can see we're gonna have to resolve this one once and for all.
 You all know this game, - right? - Oh, love it.
 Who wants to be the boss? Ladies first.
   Hey, Greenwood, what's the secret to good comedy?  Timing.
 And what's courage?  Grace under pressure.
 And who's the boss?  I'm the boss.
  I believe you are, Jerome.
 I believe you are.
 Arigato, sensei.
 Whoo! Hee!  Thank you.
 Four lunatics and Barbara? Brother, you got no luck.
 I told you civilian life was better, didn't I? Yeah, you did.
 Actually, that's kind of why I'm here.
 Yeah? Yeah.
 What are you doing here? Jim, you remember Scotty, my girlfriend.
 FiancÃ©e.
 Right, my fiancÃ©e.
 Yeah, Scotty, good to see you.
 Relax, honey bun.
 We're just talking.
 Oh, like hell you are.
 He's gonna ask you to come back to work.
 He didn't ask me anything.
 We're just having a chat.
 Oh, is that right? Is that why you're here, Detective? Just to have a chat? No, no.
 She's right.
 Harvey, I need your help.
 The case is a bear.
 We're short-handed, and, uh, I was thinking maybe you could He has a life.
 The answer is no.
 He is not coming back.
 Hon.
 I'm telling him no.
 But it's like she said, I have a life.
 I get it.
 I get it.
 I'm happy for you.
 Just a thought.
 - Wish me luck.
 - Good luck.
 Jim, one last thing.
 One last thought from your Uncle Harvey.
 These Maniax killed a bunch of people from the shipyard, right? Yellen Shipyard, yeah.
 Why there? They could've gone anywhere, killed anyone.
 But these lunatics specifically chose that shipyard.
 I wonder why.
 Good to see you.
 Scotty.
 Yeah.
 Call you back.
 Commissioner! Tell me something good.
 Please.
 Harvey isn't coming back.
 That's not good.
 But he did suggest a lead that panned out nicely.
 Turns out, the Maniax stole a refueling truck from the shipyard yesterday.
 Why wasn't it reported? It was one of over a hundred service vehicles.
 Took a while to track down the entire fleet.
 But when we did, we found that one was missing.
 Fully loaded with gasoline.
 You get a license plate? And a description of the vehicle.
 Put out an APB.
 God, I'm so glad you're back, Jim.
 Me, too.
 Wish I could say the same for Bullock.
 I-I can't believe he's really gone.
 He's a cop.
 He was born to be a cop.
 Not anymore.
 He's a happy man.
 I didn't have it in me to push him.
 You ever think about that? Walking away, I mean.
 No.
 You? I did, for a long time.
 But not anymore? I've sat back and watched all the corrupt, lazy men buy their way into this job and waste it.
 Not me, Jim.
 Not me.
 A new day.
 You're damn right.
 I'd just like to say it's been an honor and a privilege to serve you and your family, sir.
 Thank you.
 If you need any references, I'll be happy to provide them.
 Is that all you're taking with you? It's all I have, sir.
 Right.
 Well, um Oh, dear, yes.
 I best be off.
 I've got a train to catch.
 Good-bye, sir.
 Good-bye, Alfred.
 Beg your pardon, sir? I said good-bye.
 Yes.
 Good-bye, sir.
 I spy with my little eye something that is yellow.
 Score, Gotham, score! We want more! Hit 'em where it hurts and knock 'em to the floor!  Yay, Gotham! Oh.
 Hello, Ms.
 Kringle.
  Hello, Mr.
 Nygma.
 How's your day going?  Fine.
 Um, question for you.
 - Y-Yes? - Um  Did you know that houseflies hum in the key of F?  No.
  No, I-I did not know that.
 Okay, then.
 Well, uh bye.
 Bye.
 Damn it! We agreed you were going to ask her out.
 No, we didn't agree to ask her.
 We agreed to think about asking her.
 But there's no point.
 She doesn't like you.
 Maybe she'll like me.
 You ever consider that? Maybe she'll like me.
 I got confidence.
 Ladies love that.
 No, she won't like you.
 She won't.
 Go away.
 Please, just go away! Hey.
   Ooh!    We got a sighting of the stolen truck.
 Yeavely Park.
 I want you all to know this was a very difficult decision for us.
 It was between you and a senior citizen bingo party.
 In the end, we decided to skew a little younger.
 Youth won the day.
 Sorry.
 Give me an O!   I said give me a O.
 O.
 Give me an N.
 N.
 O.
 - What does that spell? Oh, no!  Do it! Do it! Do it! Ready? Okay!  This is so embarrassing.
 Anyone got a light? I do.
 Stand your ground, boys.
 They can't shoot at a bus.
 Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Aaron, Greenwood, get the truck started.
 We're gonna blow this barbecue.
 Oh.
  Light 'em up!         Everybody okay? Who broke you out, Dobkins? Gonna have to talk sooner or later; tell me now.
 I'm a victim here, sir.
 I was coerced.
 Abducted and coerced.
 - By who? - If I tell you that, I got to get some kind of guaran  (man speaking indistinctly over P.
A.
) I understand you were just trying to protect me.
 But there's nothing nothing that you can do to stop me from carrying out my father's work.
 I know that now.
 I don't want you to go, Alfred.
 But you're either with me or you're against me.
 And if you're against me, I don't have a choice.
 I'm with you, Master Bruce.
 I've always been with you.
 But what you're doing is tantamount to suicide.
 This is big boy stuff.
 You're too young; you're not ready.
 Then make me ready.
 You-You've lived a dangerous life, and you survived.
 So teach me.
 Teach me how to do the same.
 I'll do whatever it takes.
 I'll train every day.
 Yeah, well, you said that before, didn't you? That was before.
 Now I know the truth.
 And I know what I have to do.
 I'll even go back to school if you want.
 School, even? If I agree to help you, to make you ready, you must do exactly as I say and when I say it with no exceptions, is that understood? Understood.
 But, in return, you must fix that computer.
 Fix it? How on earth am I gonna do that? That's not my problem.
 I'm not the one who broke it.
 High caliber, high velocity.
 Judging by the size of the wounds, it was definitely shot from some distance.
 Someone knew how to shoot.
 Who, damn it? And why cheerleaders? Where's the motive? They didn't even ask for a ransom.
 They want headlines.
 They want mass panic.
 - Well, they got it.
 Yeah.
 Let's see if we can I.
D.
 that bullet.
 Never know your luck.
   Holding up? Holding up.
 Love you.
 Likewise.
   Gin and tonic, please, uh, governor.
 Ice and a slice.
 Nice place.
 It is.
 Been here before, then, have you? It's my regular spot.
 Oh, right, you're a local.
 Nice.
 Don't I know you? Do you? Yeah.
 You're that Mr.
 Fox, that scientific chap from Wayne Enterprises, ain't you? That is me.
 Alfred Pennyworth.
 Young Master Bruce Wayne's guardian.
 Ah, yes.
 It's a funny old game though, ain't it? Coincidence, I mean, me bumping into you like this.
 I mean I was just thinking about you.
 Hmm.
 Okay, Mr.
 Pennyworth, I'll bite.
 What were you thinking about me? Oh, no.
 Alfred, please.
 Please, Lucius.
 Lucius.
 Lucius.
 You know I once knew this geezer called Onslow in the Isle of Dogs in the East End of London.
 Lairy little scallywag, he was.
 He was, uh, too smart by half; never trusted him.
 Anyway, one day, Lucius, he comes bowling up to me, and he asks me to do him this right iffy favor.
 Oh, it doesn't matter what it was.
 The point being, against my better judgment, I agreed to do it.
 But, Lucius, I told him, I told him straight, I said, You let me down, Onslow, I'll tuck you up, sunshine, like a kipper.
 He swears blind, swears on his mother's grave he'd never do such a thing, but of course he did.
 Couldn't help himself; he let me down.
 So I tucked him up.
 Like a kipper.
 What is a kipper? It's a type of smoked fish.
 Very nice with eggs and brown toast for breakfast.
 But what I learned from Onslow is this.
 There are two types of people on this planet, you see.
 Them you can trust and them you can't.
 I cannot disagree.
 Which kind are you? Both kinds of people would give you the same answer, wouldn't they? Exactly.
 Exactly right.
 There lieth the problem, Lucius.
 You see, I need to confide in you.
 But I need to know that you're trustworthy.
 Perhaps I should decline your confidence.
 I don't like the sound of these kippers.
 Yeah, well, it's a bit late for that, unfortunately.
 I mean, it's you, after all, Lucius, that created this mess when you told young Master Bruce that his dear old dead dad was a stoic.
 Ah.
 Ah, exactly.
 You see, there's a problem.
 I got no one else to turn to.
 I have to confide in you.
 I see.
 Do you? Let me just be crystal clear about this.
 If it turns out that I can't trust you, I swear on my mother's grave, you, my old sausage are a dead man.
 I have only the best intentions for Bruce Wayne.
 Well, another gin and tonic please, uh, governor.
 And whatever this young man is drinking, one for yourself.
 How are you at fixing computers?  - Hey, Alvarez! - Yo.
 Let ballistics know we got a red ball for them, will you? On it.
 Gordon.
 Hello, Jim.
 It's Barbara.
 Hi, Barbara.
 Oh, me? I'm fabulous.
 How are you? I'm good.
 What's new? Oh, Mr.
 Cool Guy, huh? You must be so mad at me.
 Listen to me.
 If you turn yourself in, I can help you.
  How, Jim? By taking me back to Arkham? I don't think so.
 You're sick.
 Oh.
 Of course.
 Everything's always my fault.
 So typical.
 Listen to me.
 I know you, Barbara.
 I know you.
 You're a good, kind woman.
 This isn't you.
  Oh, you could always make me laugh.
  How do I look? I need to talk to Commissioner Essen right away.
 It's an emergency.
 Yeah, go ahead.
 She's right upstairs.
 Yo, Commish.
 Yeah? Heard you were looking for us.
   Barbara! Don't move.
 You're wrong about me, Jim.
 I tried telling you, but you never listen.
 I'm listening now.
 Yeah, sure you are.
 Now.
 Come on.
 Let's go talk this through, huh? Oh, it's too late for that.
  Ow.
  Aaron.
 That's enough.
  I'm not sick.
 I'm free.
 You don't get that.
 I could explain it, but you should probably get back to work.
 Who knows what went wrong while you were gone?       Hell of a first week you're having, Commissioner.
 I wish I could tell you that things were gonna get better for you.
 They're not.
 Here, bring that up here.
 Get a better angle of the room.
 Why are you doing this? To rule the world.
 Blah, blah, blah.
 But we'll settle for some dead cops and some good P.
R.
 -  Kidding.
 - Yeah.
 Whatever.
 I get it.
 You're just crazy.
 Crazy? Look at me.
 You can see I'm not crazy.
 Very soon, little man, you will be dead.
 And the world will go on without you.
 You'll be nothing.
 No one will even remember your name.
 Mm.
 No.
 That is where you're wrong, old lady.
 We will leave a mark on this city.
 We will spread across it like a virus.
 Do you know why? There's nothing more contagious than laughter.
 My line.
 There's nothing more contagious than laughter.
  That was strangely pleasant.
 Do it again.
 Oh! That's gonna leave a mark.
  You got me.
 My turn.
      Lee? Jim! You hurt? No.
 I I-I was in my office, and I heard gunfire and I hid.
 Where were you? Barbara was here.
 She lured me away.
 Essen!  Hang on, Cap, hang on.
 Boss, boss, stay with me.
 Breathe.
 It's a new day Jim.
 This is indeed broken.
 I have a lot of questions for you.
 Ah, I imagine so.
 Did my father tell you everything? Heavens no.
 Your father, he was a very private man.
 He had to be.
 I simply helped with technical resources, like this computer.
 - Do you know what's on it? - No.
 I didn't want to know, to be honest.
 But you can fix it? Mm, I should think so.
 But it is going to take some time.
 Well, um, thank you for your help.
 I loved your father.
 I regret that I never told him so.
 I regret that I didn't help him more.
 Hand me the soldering iron, will you? Yeah.
  Master Bruce? What is it, Alfred? Uh, how you doing, Mr.
 Nygma? I got you an aspirin.
 Thank you.
 Detective Gordon! Bruce.
 I heard the news.
 I I was worried something happened to you.
 I'm very relieved.
 Me, too.
 Th-The last time that we met, I was I was very hard on you.
 I wanted to apologize.
 You've been a really good friend.
 She was a good woman.
 Good cop.
 It's good to see you, but you don't have to do this.
 Let's not talk about it.
 We are who we are, right? No use fighting it.
 What does Scotty say? She'll understand.
 Or she won't.
 Guys.
 You need to see this.
 I'm reporting live from the scene of the GCPD massacre.
 We have just obtained video footage of the attack recorded by one of the assailants.
 I want to warn those of you watching, what you're about to see is very graphic.
 Hello, Gotham City! We're the Maniax.
 And I'm Jerome, the shot caller of our little gang.
 We're here to spread the message of wisdom and hope.
   Some people have no manners.
 You're all prisoners.
 What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds that stops you from seeing that you're just little tiny cogs in a giant absurd machine.
 Wake up! Why be a cog? Be free like us.
 Just remember, smile.
   Oh! Time to go.
 But don't worry.
 We'll be back very soon.
 Hang on to your hats, folks.
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet!    

                



                


                    			Previously on Gotham Monsters are coming, Mr.
 Mayor.
 Six criminally insane inmates busted out of Arkham Asylum.
 They want mass panic.
 Hello, Jim.
 How do I look? Barbara! - Yo, Commish.
 - Yeah.
 Don't move! You should probably get back to work.
 Who knows what went wrong while you were gone? It's a new day, Jim.
 Jerome Valeska.
 The attack on the GCPD.
 Someone on the streets is talking.
 Somebody knows something.
 Valeska has red hair, crazy laugh.
 Might be rolling with a blonde number.
 I-I don't know anything.
 - Honest! - You believe him? Nope.
 Me neither.
 It's the truth! But, hey, I-I can help you guys, you know, spread the word and stuff.
 Valeska killed a friend of ours.
 Anybody hides him, anybody protects him, they go down, too, you got it? Now spread the word.
 Sneaking out? Just like a guy.
 There are loose ends that need tying.
 Need this? Bring back bagels.
 No need for that.
 I thought Ms.
 Kean and I could have a little chat.
 Good morning.
 Jerome is waiting outside.
 Try and keep him focused.
 You be nice.
 You two seem to be getting along.
 I'm so glad.
 She needs a friend.
 My sister is a very special person.
 She seems so strong, but yet she's quite fragile.
 Sugar? Sure.
 You acquitted yourself very well at the adventure at the GCPD.
 Jim Gordon escaped the carnage unscathed.
 Top marks.
 Thank you.
 Did you know my family built this city? We carved the bedrock upon which it stands, yet there is not a bridge, an alley, a ditch that carries our name.
 My forefathers were betrayed, their legacy erased, and I am here to punish those who wronged us and reclaim what is ours.
 Strawberry? I didn't ask.
 So you're gonna take over Gotham by unleashing a bunch of loonies.
 Awesome plan.
 That's only part one.
 So what's the second part? Oh, you're gonna love it.
 There's a starring role for you.
 You'll be famous and powerful, and your fondest dream will come true.
 You know my dreams, do you? When Jim Gordon has outlived his usefulness, I'm gonna help you destroy him.
 Not kill him.
 Destroy him.
 Body and soul.
 Bang.
 Shocking images.
 Gotham is on high alert today after Look, I'm just saying, I'll chuck mopes out of windows until the cows come home, but at some point, we got to go see Penguin.
 Why would he break Jerome out of Arkham or attack the GCPD.
 He wouldn't, but that weasel's running things now.
 - If there's chatter, he'd know it.
 - I'll think about it.
 - Jim - I'll think about it! Alvarez, where are you with Jerome's circus contacts? - Circus is upstate.
 I'm just waiting - Follow up.
 His father's probably with him.
 He covered for him once before.
 He might have some information.
 Do it.
 Yo, Detective! Which escapee are you tracking? Helzinger.
 - No one's seen him.
 - He's six-seven, 275, with the mind of a five-year-old.
 Somebody's seen him.
 Hey! What are you doing? That stays up until we have her killer in custody.
 - You understand? - Yes, sir.
 Sarah Essen and nine of your brothers were killed in this house.
 In our house! Their murderer stood right there, and he laughed at us.
 Never forget that.
 What?! So how are you? I'm fine.
 Really? Look, I know Essen was your friend.
 Lee, whatever you're about to say, I know it's coming from a good place, but I can't hear it right now.
 So, the Gotham Children's Hospital gala is tonight, which I helped organize.
 I can't.
 - You can't go? - No.
 Even though a few hours away from all of this might actually help? Lee.
 Okay.
 I just have to tell you something, because if I don't and you find out, you're gonna be pissed.
 There's gonna be a magician.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Stop beating yourself up.
 - I'm trying.
 - I know you are.
 I should have been here.
 I wasn't.
 Stop it.
 Kiss me.
 Kiss me.
 Better? Not to interrupt your weirdly timed make-out session, but Alvarez got in touch with the circus manager.
 The blind fortune teller, Jerome's dad, bailed on him, stayed in town.
 Got an address.
 I'll call you.
 Okay.
 Who's there? I know someone's there.
 Hi-ya, Pops.
 Long time no see.
 So, how you doing? Ah, the silent treatment, eh? Here, I'll tell you a story.
 Hmm.
 Oh.
 You remember Kansas City, Dad? The circus went through town every spring right around my birthday.
 There was this guy.
 Him and my mom used to drink and fornicate and beat the crap out of me.
 They'd make a whole night out of it.
 And I remember one time it was my ninth birthday him and my mom had just finished round one of boozing, boning, beating up Jerome, and were deciding to take a little break.
 Anyway Mm.
 I was outside the trailer, and you were there.
 And you said, Why are you crying, Jerome? It's my birthday.
 And my mom and the snake guy are beating me.
 then you said, This world doesn't care about you or anyone else, Jerome.
 Better to realize that now.
 And that was it.
 You see, there's this guy, Dad.
 He believes in me.
 He thinks I'm gonna be a star.
 And, tonight, all of Gotham will see that, too.
 Except for you.
 'Cause you'll be, you know, dead.
 it's too late.
 You don't have to do this.
 No.
 I'm pretty sure I do.
 I was a bad father, but I did love you.
 To kill me for that That's not why I'm gonna kill you.
 Plans to Arkham Asylum.
 Look at these.
 Ah.
 Letters between you and your troubled son.
 Innocent at first glance, but Detective Gordon you remember him, right? he'll feel little bumps.
 A secret message written in Braille between you and your son, discussing my escape.
 Finally, the knockout gas used to disable the orderlies.
 'Cause, you see, Dad, this guy I was telling you about, he's the one who broke me out of Arkham.
 He doesn't want anyone to know about that.
 Obviously.
 So the police will find these letters, mmm, and they'll think, The blind old fool really loved his son.
 What a wonderful father.
 Oh.
 There won't be a dry eye in the house.
 They'll never believe it.
 Ah, sure, they will.
 Cops are dumb.
 There's nothing to eat in this dump.
 Finish up and let's go.
 Sorry you're gonna miss my big night, Dad.
 But, hey, you're psychic.
 So, tell me, do I kill? You.
.
 Will be a curse upon Gotham.
 Children will wake from sleeps screaming at the thought of you.
 Your legacy will be death and madness.
 Ha, ha, ha.
 Well say hi to Mom for me.
 GCPD! GCPD! Mr.
 Cicero, it's Detective Gordon.
 We need to speak with you about your son.
 Mr.
 Cicero? Mr.
 Cicero?! Harvey, window! Harvey? Detective Gordon.
 Old pal.
 That gas sure packs a wallop, huh? That's cute.
 I'm sensing anger.
 You killed Sarah Essen.
 Now I'm gonna kill you.
 Don't shoot him.
 How about a little flesh wound? No, no.
 My dibs.
 This is a waste of time.
 We had a deal, didn't we, Master Bruce.
 Part of which was you resume your normal lifestyle.
 Your parents were both patrons to the Children's Hospital.
 Therefore, it makes you a patron.
 Besides there's gonna be a magician.
 And you like magicians, don't you? No, I don't.
 I hate magicians.
 You know what I said about being normal? Excuse me.
 I'm Lee Thompkins.
 I work with James Gordon.
 He's mentioned you, and I saw you and thought Of course.
 It's very nice to meet you.
 Nice to meet you.
 This is my guardian, Alfred Pennyworth.
 It's an absolute pleasure.
 - Thank you.
 - How is Detective Gordon doing since the attack on the precinct? I was thinking I should call him.
 He'd appreciate that.
 Can I get you something to drink? Uh, just water.
 Thank you.
 So I hear there's gonna be a magician.
 Hello, Selina.
 Hey.
 I-I didn't expect to see you here.
 Well, you want to steal stuff, it helps to go where the rich people are.
 You do know this is a benefit for Children's Hospital? - So? - So these people are here for a good cause.
 Me eating is a good cause.
 Besides, didn't I steal something for you, once? Selina, that was different.
 Right.
 How'd that go? You get into that guy's safe? Yes.
 Though things didn't turn out quite like I planned.
 A lot's happened since then.
 Alfred says there's gonna be a magician.
 I'm working.
 And I hate magicians.
 See you around, Bruce.
 So you want to share your plan? Remember I told you I could divine the thing a person truly wants? What Gotham wants is a hero.
 And tonight.
 I'm going to give them one.
 Shall we? Jerome and Tabby went on ahead.
 Great cape.
 Thank you for filling in on such short notice.
 But how did you hear our magician dropped out, Mr ? Rodolfo.
 Well, you know, magic.
 Oh, I won't be needing that.
 - Come on.
 - I'm sorry, but really, there is no mystery.
 Tabitha, have you met Deputy Mayor Kane? Harrison, this is my Tabitha.
 Ah, nice to meet you.
 Uh, and could you please tell your brother that when a handsome billionaire appears out of nowhere, people get curious.
 Where'd he come from? How'd he make his money? Who's he dating? My wife would kill me if I don't get something a-a tidbit.
 He's a monster in the sack.
 Do you have any news of Mayor James? No.
 No, it's a real mystery.
 We don't know where he is.
 How intriguing.
 Harrison, would you mind? A little family business.
 Of course.
 Miss Galavan.
 Everything's ready.
 See you at home.
 So, uh, how do you go from being in the Royal Marines to a butler? Well, it's a bit tedious, really, after a while.
 You know, parachuting into one global hot spot another.
 Warlords putting ridiculous bounties on your head.
 Gets a bit boring, really.
 You have amazing stories.
 Yeah, well, you know, one or two.
 You know, I don't really get nights off, but if ever you'd like to pop by Wayne Manor for dinner one evening, I Oh, that's very kind of you Mr.
 Pennyworth, but No.
 Alfred.
 Please.
 Alfred.
 Alfred.
 That's very kind of you, but Now, having said that, I don't see why I can't take a night off, and I I happen to know the head chef at Chez Parnes.
 Well, I-I'm afraid I Did you say Chez Parnes? I've been trying to eat there for quite some time.
 You have the most beautiful eyes.
 Oh, wow.
 Okay, well, thank you, but, uh Alfred, I'd like to leave.
 Yeah, um What about Dr.
 Thompkins' water? And, of course, you're gonna miss the magician.
 Sorry, I must have forgotten your water.
 Alfred, I still want to leave.
 Are you not feeling well? Oh, n-no, he's-he's absolutely fine.
 He's fine.
 Why don't you just pop off to the bar, Master Bruce, and Show's about to start.
 Is it time? I roped myself into MC duties for the night.
 I hope you'll stay for the show.
 I wouldn't miss it for the world.
 What? Good evening.
 I'm Dr.
 Lee Thompkins.
 For the past five years, I've had the honor of being part of the Children's Hospital.
 Thank you for your support.
 And thank you so much for coming out tonight.
 Over the years, we've had magicians come and entertain our children.
 And so tonight, we have one of the magicians here for you.
 Without further ado, please allow me to present to you the Great Rodolfo.
 Ha! Greetings, ladies and germs! I am indeed the Great Rodolfo.
 Please ogle my lovely assistant.
 Ooh! For my first act, I'll require a volunteer.
 Let me see.
 Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck goose! Go on, Master Bruce.
 Be a sport.
 Don't keep the lady waiting.
 Fine.
 Hello, young man.
 Does this handsome gentleman have a name? - Bruce.
 - Bruce! Well, Bruce, this won't hurt a bit.
 Is there a doctor in the house? Just wait! Wait! Wait one second! Go home.
 I'm fine.
 You've been running this since last night, and you got a face full of that gas.
 Go home.
 You going home? I didn't think so.
 Oh.
 Maybe I will go get some sleep.
 Yeah? Good idea.
 But we got somewhere, right? At least now we know who broke Jerome out of Arkham.
 Yeah.
 Crazy old blind man that lived alone.
 The clever crazy old blind man.
 If his father broke him out, why'd Jerome kill him, huh? He was probably playing this maniac shtick since you sent him away.
 He was just a kid.
 Every evil bastard in the world was just a kid once.
 Yeah.
 But I don't think it was his father that broke him out.
 Well, cool.
 Back to square one.
 All right, I will go and get some sleep.
 For the record, I knew Essen a hell of a lot longer than you.
 She saved my ass hundreds of times.
 You really should go home.
 First thing tomorrow, we'll go see Penguin.
 You're right.
 He's got his ears on the street.
 Jim.
 Never mind.
 I'll see you tomorrow.
 Give 'em a wave.
 Some people say Bruce has a split personality.
 Very good, Master Bruce.
 For my next illusion, I'd like to call to the stage esteemed Deputy Mayor Harrison Kane.
 Is there something familiar to you about those two? Oh, my God.
 Lee, I was just Jim, it's Barbara.
 She's here.
 And-and I think maybe Jerome By the way, nobody here is getting out alive.
 Right, Master Bruce, time to leave.
 Ta-da! - Selina! - Bruce! You! What's going on? Hostage situation.
 The magician just killed the Deputy Mayor.
 It's Jerome Valeska, the man that killed Commissioner Essen.
 Who's in charge here? I guess you are.
 Lee.
 Thank God.
 I've been trying to Sorry, Jimbo.
 It's just little old me.
 Jerome.
 Are you outside? You are, aren't you? Oh, goody! I swear to God, if you've hurt her Breathe, James.
 I haven't touched a hair on your girlfriend's pretty head.
 See for yourself.
 This is live television after all.
 The feed just came back.
 You son of a bitch.
 True, but not the point.
 Hey, let's talk about what I want.
 Excuse me.
 $47 million, a helicopter, obviously, the dry cleaning I left at Mr.
 Chang's be careful, the man is a crook and, mm, I don't know, a pony.
 Uh You got ten minutes, or I start killing people.
 Remember, this is being broadcast to every home in Gotham, so, you know, don't let people die.
 Bye.
 I think that went well.
 Enough! You need to pack up your pathetic little sideshow and leave.
 Is that right? It may be presumptuous to speak for all the citizens of Gotham.
 But we are sick of you! You're a small, vicious man with a pathetic need for attention.
 Enough, man.
 For God's sakes, enough.
 I'm curious what your leverage is here, Mr ? Theo Galavan.
 Well, Mr.
 Theo Galavan, if you don't sit down, uh, I'm going to shoot you.
 In the face.
 I know there is some human decency left in you.
 If you need to take a hostage, take me.
 But let these people go home to their families, to their children.
 Boring.
 Right? Get your men.
 We're going in.
 I used this to sneak into the party.
 We're lucky those dummies didn't know about it.
 - Wait.
 - We're almost outside.
 Wait.
 I have to go back.
 Are you crazy? That guy was killing people! Yes, and Alfred's back there.
 I'm not going back.
 I don't expect you to.
 Selina I miss you.
 I just wanted to say that.
 You're refusing a direct order? I could have your stripes.
 That maniac killed the commissioner.
 Not my men.
 We're not equipped for this.
 Fine.
 I'll go in alone.
 Oh.
 Hold very still.
 Oh.
 I can't look.
 Someone tell me how it turns out.
 Damn! Turn around.
 Well, clap! Ooh! So, Lee, how's Jim doing? I hope he's not blaming himself for this whole Essen being killed thing.
 You are one crazy bitch.
 So rude.
 You know, I'm gonna I'm gonna make a prediction.
 Ow! Within a year, Jim and I will be back together.
 Want to know why? Because we're both the same.
 We both have a dark side.
 And one day, we will tell our grandchildren about how this man-eating harpy almost tore us apart! But in the end, love conquered all.
 - You - I'm sorry.
 What's that? Hasn't been ten minutes.
 I need to buy you a watch.
 Well I think it's time for tonight's first official victim, you all know and love, poor rich boy, parents murdered in an alley, and my favorite volunteer.
 Where is Bruce Wayne?! You know I'm an orphan, too, Bruce.
 I killed my parents though.
 Where are you hiding? Bruce! Where are you, buddy? Kill his butler.
 Come on, move it, butler.
 Alright.
 Last chance, Bruce, but it's about to get very butler brain out here.
 D-Detective Gordon.
 He's going to kill Alfred.
 I have to help him.
 Brucey! No.
 It's you he wants.
 Bruce, just wants you.
 I will not let him hurt Alfred.
 I'm bored.
 Shoot the butler.
 Stop! What the bloody hell are you doing, Bruce? There's a gun in my jacket.
 Detective Gordon's behind the curtain.
 Let gets this started, huh? You, check behind the curtain; make sure no one's playing silly buggers.
 Drop the knife! I don't have a clean shot! Stay calm, Bruce.
 Seems like we got ourselves a pickle.
 What do you say, Brucey boy? Want to boost our ratings, huh? Smile.
 I said, enough! I know, I know.
 This is not what we rehearsed.
 I'm so sorry, Jerome.
 You have real talent.
 But now, you see, the plot thickens.
 Enter the hero.
 You said I was gonna be Jim! Stop her! A pony.
  Uh See, someone like that has no interest in building things.
 He's not part of a tradition.
 Hmm? It's chaos for chaos' sake.
 Perhaps I could use a new laugh.
 Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Huh? Wow.
 Dude! Color me impressed.
 You know, if I close my eyes, I can still see you holding Fish's umbrella.
 Yes, Ms.
 Mooney.
 No, Ms.
 Mooney.
 Whatever you say, Ms.
 Mooney.
 That wig looks great on you, Ms.
 Mooney.
 Seriously, the worm has turned.
 Detective Bullock.
 I heard you rejoined the force.
 I am so happy.
 But aren't you missing all of the excitement? Yeah, I got the word too late.
 Besides, I want to talk to you.
 Of course.
 Always happy to help.
 See, there's talk on the street that Jim Gordon did a favor for you, collected a debt and the guy ended up dead.
 Rumors.
 Rumors.
 Huh.
 Well, then again, where there's smoke Jim shouldn't worry about that.
 He and I are good friends.
 Well, see, that's the problem, Oswald; I think he is worried.
 Because something happened today, and you were the obvious person to come to.
 And I sensed Jim was a little reluctant to come down here.
 Like I said, he shouldn't worry.
 As long as you two remain friends.
 Exactly.
 Yeah.
 I got half a mind to take you outside and beat you senseless with a garbage can.
 Maybe some other time.
 Call yourself whatever you want, man! The King of Gotham.
 But, to me, you'll always be that little umbrella boy.
 And if you come after Jim Gordon, you got to come after me.
 And I still owe you for Fish.
 But, seriously, this place is amazing.
 Give me another drink! You were very brave.
 You helped save the lives of everyone in here.
 Your parents, they would've been proud.
 That they would've been.
 They also would've given me the sack for letting you do something so idiotic.
 It was all of us.
 We were a team.
 Yeah.
 I guess we were.
 Is he okay? Fine.
 Though I'd still like him to get checked out at the hospital.
 Barbara gave him quite a knock.
 Any word on her? No, she went through a trapdoor in the stage.
 They must have always been planning to use that as their exit.
 Don't worry.
 We'll find her.
 Uh, Mr.
 Galavan, sir.
 Alfred Pennyworth.
 I'd just like to thank you for saving - young Master Wayne's life.
 - Oh.
 If there's anything I can ever do for you, sir Or I.
 I really just did what any citizen of Gotham would have done.
 I wish that were true.
 Jim Gordon.
 Theo.
 Well, if you ever need anything, please, call.
 We're all in this together, right? Thank you, sir.
 Right, well, I suppose I better be getting this young man home.
 It's been much more of an exciting evening than originally planned.
 I never did like magicians.
 Good night.
 It was very nice meeting you, - Dr.
 Thompkins.
 - And you, Bruce.
 Good night's sleep, you'll be right as roses.
 I do hope we get to see you again soon.
 Thank you.
 Alfred.
 Sure you're okay? I'm fine.
 Kiss me? Jim Kiss me.
 - Oh, bugger.
 - Alfred.
 - You knew, didn't you? - I didn't know, Alfred.
 You did.
 You let me make a right mug of me-self.
 Alfred, I had no idea.
 - You did.
 - I didn't know.
 Well, I didn't know.
 Despite the presence of the GCPD, it was billionaire Theo Galavan newly arrived in Gotham but already making his name who stood up to the escaped lunatic.
 Am I a hero? Hmm.
 Apparently.
 I think tonight, the people of Gotham have said, Enough.
 The reign of tyranny is over.
 Now the real fun begins.
 Poor Jerome.
 Yes, very sad.
 Such a compelling character.
 But limited, you know? He was never gonna last long.
 Hmm.
 I don't know about that.
 The kid had a way about him.
 Oh, poor baby, did you get a bump?  The killer, Jerome Valeska, is dead, his murderous escapades left a deep impression on Gotham.
 Nobody here is getting out alive.
 Coming through.
 Bang.
 You will be a curse upon Gotham.
 Children will wake from sleep screaming at the thought of you.
 Your legacy will be death and madness.
   

                



                


 Previously on Gotham My forefathers were betrayed, their legacy erased, and I am here to punish those who wronged us.
 - We have a deal? - We do.
 I'll do whatever it takes.
 I'll train every day.
 Yeah.
 Well, you said that before, didn't you? I'll even go back to school.
  I saved your life.
 You wanted to do it, too, you just didn't have the guts.
 Selena, I miss you.
 This is not what we rehearsed.
 I'm so sorry, Jerome.
 Enter the hero.
 Gentlemen! Ladies! Others! Let us discuss the future with a little civility, shall we? So not one of you knows who orchestrated and/or executed the Arkham breakout? I find that hard to believe.
 I mean, the cops' only lead is an old blind man, for God's sake.
 A blind man! Then who here is to be trusted? Because someone knows.
 Uh we thought it was you.
 Why would I do that? We've never had it better.
 I gave you all of the freedom in the world and business boomed.
 For all of us.
 A new generation.
 Then that ginger maniac had to spoil everything.
 Even now he's dead, the public is still terrified, business is in the can and what are we doing? Fighting among ourselves.
 Is this how any of us want to live? Squabbling, brawling, running, hiding? This city belongs to us now.
 But kids, that brings responsibilities.
 We need to restore confidence in our brand, if you will.
 We need discipline and unity, yes? There will be no more chaos.
 No more gang wars.
 No more blood in the streets, scaring decent folk.
 From now on, if you want to kill someone, blackmail, steal or kidnap anyone, I need to hear about it first.
 Understand? - Yeah, got it.
 - Yeah.
 - Fine.
 - Yeah.
 Boss, there's somebody  Bravo.
 Quite the King Solomon.
 - You had them nicely in line.
 - Who are you? My brother would very much like to talk to you.
 Alone.
 Why you looking at me like that? You don't know me.
 Relax, Butch.
 He has issues.
 Bipolar.
 She don't know me, I'm just saying.
  Your brother? Theodore Galavan.
 There's a car waiting for you outside.
 I'm sick and tired of your holier-than-thou crap, Gordon! Yeah? Then do some police work.
 Last arrest you made was your bookie.
 My name is Nathaniel Barnes.
 Captain Nathaniel Barnes.
 That's right.
 I'm your new boss.
 You.
 Clean that up.
 You know when this place was built? Over 100 years ago.
 Can you imagine how many perps have been booked in here since that time? All the murderers, rapists, thieves that have been locked up? They don't make 'em like this anymore strong, sturdy.
 And yet just days ago, an escaped convict just strolls in here, into our house our house! And murders your commissioner and nine of your fellow comrades.
 I wasn't even here and I'm ashamed.
 Are you all ashamed? I hope so.
 Anyone that's here that's not ashamed, and angry, should resign.
 Right now.
 Huh.
 Some of you are lying to yourselves.
 I've got your files here.
 I've read them all.
 Step forward if you hear your name called.
 Pollard.
 Guthrie.
 Coulson.
 Dowler.
 Brooks.
 Perez.
 Hightower.
 You aren't ashamed.
 You have no shame.
 You're not police, you're low-life criminals.
 Bribery, drug abuse, extortion, racketeering Sons of bitches! You're all fired! Drop off your badges and your guns with the desk sergeant on your way out.
 Hey.
 You can't do this! We got rights! Yes, you're right.
 You do have rights.
 You have the right to remain silent.
 You have the right to an attorney.
 Take him.
 From now on any officer, detective, rookie or clerk who breaks the law will not just lose their job, they will go to jail.
 If you turn a blind eye to crime, I will bust you.
 If you fail to help a fellow officer because of cowardice or apathy, I will bust you! What the hell are you still doing here? Don't make me mad.
 Anyone who didn't hear their name called, get back to work.
 I'd like to see you in my office, please.
 Well, what do you think about what I said out there? I agree with every word, sir.
 Every word, huh? You a sycophant, Gordon? No, sir.
 No, sir.
 I've read all your files.
 Army, Academy, GCPD.
 You're a troublemaker.
 A fighter.
 Is that an accurate assessment? Yes, sir.
 Good.
 You're my second in command.
 Starting now, Jim, we're gonna fix this department and bring respect for law and order back to this city.
 Yes, sir.
 We're, uh kind of shorthanded.
 What, you think I cut too deep? You could have thrown out 20 more guys and not hit bottom.
 Fixing this department's gonna be tough.
 Maybe tougher than you think sir.
 Welcome to my unit, you sad-ass Army hump.
 Tough is what we eat for breakfast.
  A jarhead, huh? Who would've guessed? Sir.
 I hope you just told him he made a huge mistake.
 I don't think he did.
 Come on, Jim, we've seen his type come and go.
 Idealists, always looking to walk the straight line Gotham doesn't have straight lines, it's got twists and turns and dead ends.
 Yeah.
 But it doesn't have to be that way.
 With Mayor Jam still missing and the deputy mayor recently murdered, the need for leadership at City Hall is of paramount concern to Gotham's citizens.
 Today, two more hopeful candidates have thrown their hats into the ring.
 Janice Caulfield is a city councillor who began her political career as an environmental activist.
 Randall Hobbs the longest-serving teamster boss in Gotham's history, is another candidate with a strong base.
 In the latest polls, though, a surprise surge for a man who has not even declared his candidacy Theo Galavan.
 The dashing billionaire businessman has not ruled out a bid for the mayor's job, but he is considering his options, according to a spokesman.
 Mr.
 Cobblepot, finally we meet.
 Call me Penguin.
 I thought I heard you hated that name.
 It grew on me.
 Penguin, it is.
 Please, sit.
 How's your head? Oh, healing, thank you.
  Gave me quite a scare.
 You were lucky to get out of there with your life.
 Wasn't I just?  Was it luck? You are a clever man.
 Perfect timing, dear.
 Do you two know each other? We've met.
 Oh, my.
 The Arkham breakout, the GCPD massacre, Jerome and the Maniax.
 All you.
  Of course.
 Guilty.
 It was foolish of me to think I could trick the The King of Gotham.
 Here.
 You need this more than me.
 I'll make another.
 My sister tells me you're doing a stellar job of organizing your new empire.
 I try.
 You're not The King of Gotham.
 You're The King of Garbage.
 A year ago, I held Fish Mooney's umbrella.
 Now she's dead by my hand.
 Along with Maroni.
 Falcone is in hiding, and all of their businesses are mine.
 They all underestimated me.
 I suggest you not make the same mistake.
 My sister is too blunt.
 But she is honest.
 The foundations of this great city were laid very dedicated people.
 Now it's an old crumbling pigsty, full of human waste.
 It's time to move into the future.
 A cleaner, brighter future.
 Uh those are all residential areas, so thousands of homes would have to be destroyed, wouldn't they? Yeah.
 In order to rebuild, I need first to destroy, but I can't do that.
 I mean, watch the news, I'm a hero.
 But you have a certain flair for such a task.
 You, Penguin you will be my destroyer.
  Truly, I'm flattered.
 Thank you so much for thinking of me, but my dear sir, you have me all wrong.
 I have no flair for destruction.
 I'm a builder, a problem solver.
 Besides, such a huge project would need the support of hundreds of city officials.
 Yes, only the highest authority could see it through correctly.
 Say, a mayor with a landslide mandate.
 But you're not a candidate.
 Oh, I will be.
 By popular demand.
 Alas, some of my fellow candidates actually stand a chance of winning, so they'll have to go.
  Go? And I'm gonna need you to take a crack at me also.
 And miss, of course.
 Don't want anyone to think that I had anything to do with my fellow candidates' demise.
 That's smart thinking.
 However, with all due respect, Mr.
 Galavan, I'm not your man.
 You need an assassin.
 This is Gotham, you can find them in the phone book.
 Under A.
 One moment, Mr.
 Penguin.
 I'm sorry, I took you for a man of vision.
 Tabitha, you want to get the remote, dear? Yay.
 Before you leave, my sister would love to show you her favorite reality show.
 She's addicted.
  Mmm, she's being kind of dull right now, but sometimes she cries and bangs on the door.
 - Please.
 Mother.
 You'll pay for this.
  That's the spirit.
 They die, your mother lives.
 Simple.
 Please! I swear, I swear, I don't know nothing    Thompkins.
 Good morning, Dr.
 Thompkins.
 Captain Barnes, GCPD.
 Captain Barnes.
 Hi.
 I hear great things about you, Doc.
 Get ready to get real busy.
 We're gonna be sending you a whole lot of dead bad guys.
 Oh, uh, okay-okay.
 May I speak to Jim? He wants to talk to you.
 This is Gordon.
00.
 The academy, yes, sir.
 If you don't mind me asking, sir Everybody knows you're banging the M.
E.
 See you in an hour.
 Oldest in your class.
 Not the strongest or the fastest or even the most academically gifted either, and yet you finished at the top of your class.
 Now how did you do that? I'll tell you how.
 You were a soldier.
 You saw combat while your classmates were still playing with themselves in their parents' basements.
 You got blood on your face.
 You could say that.
 You're a warrior, Jim.
 So am I.
 But you can't carry on the way you've been, going after everyone on your own.
 You need help that you can rely on.
 With all due respect, sir What if there were a team of young cops who haven't been bought yet? Not jaded, not corrupted.
 Still filled with hope and faith in the system.
 Cadets.
 This is the greatest academy in the country.
 Graduation is next week.
 We could grab a group of their finest before some precinct kills their spirit.
 Gus.
 - Captain Barnes.
 This is Gordon.
 Sure, I remember this guy.
 He argued a lot.
 I'd like to think I was raising questions.
 -  - What do you got for us? This way.
   Keep your eye on the little one.
 The one getting her ass handed to her? Wait.
 -  -  Patience.
 Not your strong virtue, if I remember right, Gordon.
 State wrestling champ, academy running back.
 Why this place and not a sports scholarship? People from my neighborhood don't get scholarships.
 They join gangs, sell drugs.
 I needed to change the direction my life was going.
 Mr.
 Martinez says here you're the best shot this school's ever seen.
 Where'd you learn to shoot? Gotham gun range.
 One of my mother's three jobs was cleaning it.
 When she died, the owner let me go there after hours and practice, until I worked out my anger.
 I still go there.
 You're way too smart to be here, Garrett.
 Don't tell me your father's a cop? Negative.
 My father's family business was destroyed by armed thugs who demanded he pay them protection money.
 When he refused, they beat him half to death.
 I'm here to make sure that doesn't ever happen again.
 Yes, sir.
 Congratulations.
 You are now Unit Alpha of the GCPD Strike Force under the command of Detective James Gordon.
 You answer only to him, and him only to me.
 Dismissed.
 Strike force? Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it? They're good kids.
 But facing what's out there at their age? That's a big risk, sir.
 True.
 What do we got to lose? Yes, sir.
 For your acts of courage in the face of overwhelming uncertainty, the city of Gotham would like to give you this token of appreciation.
 The Medal of Valor and Bravery.
   - Mr.
 Galavan.
 - Uh, please Theo.
 Everyone okay? Everyone?   You know what? Gothamites don't buckle under pressure, and neither will I.
 We will not be intimidated by the scum that seek to reduce this great city of Gotham to ruins.
 If the bad guys want to stop me running, well, then I guess I got no choice.
 I will run for mayor.
 Hello, Caulfield for Mayor.
 Yes, uh will do! Excuse me, you can't go in there.
 Miss Caulfield, what a pleasure.
 Allow me to introduce myself.
 I can see what you are.
 How did you get in? I know it's late, but I'm afraid there's no time for delay.
 Someone tried to kill Theo Galavan this morning.
 Are you here to kill me? Actually, yes.
 Please, no.
 I'm a mother.
 - Wait! - I have a mother, too.
  Steady now, folks.
 Just think of blue skies and cornfields.
 That's what I do.
 Why are you doing this? Darling, I got no freaking idea.
 We've been doing crazy stuff all day long.
 Well, we're away then.
 Sorry to ruin your evening.
 Now, remember Yeah.
 I got your names and addresses.
 So think about your families and keep mum, eh?   Are you waiting for someone? No.
 That's your job.
 That's for Reggie.
 I know you killed him.
 Now, I don't know what you want with Master Bruce, but I'm certain that his life's gonna be a damn sight better without you in it.
 So you do yourself a favor, treacle, and jog on.
  All good.
 Oh, Master Bruce.
 You know, I could always pull out front, if you want.
 No, uh, Alfred, I don't want the other kids to see To see that you've got a butler.
 Yeah, I completely understand that.
 I made dinner reservations, as requested, for tomorrow night.
 Mr.
 Galavan suggested the Regal Hotel.
 It's very posh.
 You're gonna be forking out serious dosh for that, I'll tell you.
 He saved my life.
 Dinner's the least I can do to repay him.
 Uh, Master Bruce, where are you going? Now, I clocked Wayne Manor at exactly six and a half miles.
 It should take 90 minutes to two hours, depending on how many times you stop, of course.
 Now, you said you wanted to train.
 To prepare.
 Well, this is it.
 Wait, you you expect me to-to walk? No, Master Bruce.
 I expect you to run.
     Miss Kringle, ever since I first laid eyes on you, I've felt this deep connection.
  Perhaps you've felt it, too? Ugh.
 How cheesy.
 Miss Kringle, you've perhaps felt my affections from afar.
 Afar? Really? Oh, God.
 Miss Kringle  Be quiet.
 I don't need your opinion.
 What you need is to stop mumbling and fumbling and tell her what's up.
 Well, she's been bullied and taken for granted for too long.
 - And I want her to understand - You saved her life! For God's sake! She owes you.
 Take what you deserve.
 Guys  Miss Kringle.
 Dinner, tonight.
 Um Chez Moi.
00.
 Okay.
 I'd like that.
 You will.
 A wise cop once said, if you catch a kid smashing a window, even a small one, bust him.
 You let it slide, and he'll smash another one.
 Then he'll tag a wall, steal a bike, rob a store, maybe hold someone up.
 Crime unpunished is a crime in itself.
 This city is bleeding to death from the amount of free passes we hand out.
 Time to put a tourniquet over that wound.
 From now on no one gets a free pass.
 What is this strike force for? To send a message that this epidemic of lawlessness will no longer be treated but extinguished.
 With extreme prejudice.
 Gentlemen, lady, your new uniforms.
 Sir, got a caller.
 Says Councillor Caulfield has been attacked.
 Says she's dead.
  No security cameras.
 Galavan and now her.
 Looks like a damn pattern.
 Only she's dead.
 Come on, people! - Who knows what? - Just give us a name, a description.
 You will not have to testify.
 They have our names and addresses.
 All right, Hanson, can you show me  Ms.
 Caulfield was stabbed repeatedly.
 Probably drowned in her own blood.
 Forget it, Jim.
 The man with the knife was short, fancy clothes.
 Walked funny.
 Ah, Mr.
 Galavan.
 Thank you for meeting me.
 It's an honor.
 The pleasure's all mine.
 I'll meet you in the lobby, Master Bruce.
 - Oh, why not dine with us? - That's very kind of you, sir, but I don't think it's appropriate.
 And I know that Master Bruce wants to speak to you on his own.
 Sir.
 Thanks, Alfred.
 Enjoy.
  You like this place? I've never been here before.
 To be honest, I don't - go out much.
 - Well, I hope I can change that.
 There's always some tedious function - I could drag you to.
 - I just I wanted this opportunity to thank you, in person, for saving my life.
 Oh, you're very kind.
 The truth is, I don't know what came over me.
 I don't think I was in complete control of my faculties.
 I also wanted to speak with you face-to-face.
 It's regarding your parents' passing.
 I find it astonishing that the police have failed to produce any evidence or any real suspect in all this time.
 It is disappointing.
 Even your father's own company, -  - Wayne Enterprises, has failed -  - to advance the investigation in any way.
 It's shocking.
 Yes, Mr.
 Galavan, it's-it's very disappointing.
  That's Silver.
 Uh, I'm sorry? Silver St.
 Cloud.
 Her father was my stepbrother.
 He passed, sadly.
 She's my ward now.
 Would you like to meet her? Yes.
 Hello, my dear.
  Uncle.
 I'd like to introduce you to Bruce Wayne.
 Nice to meet you, Bruce.
 - Hello.
 -  I was early, so I came out here.
 It's such a warm day.
 Do you know, I do believe that you two will be sharing a school soon.
 Anders Prep, yes? Silver just got back to Gotham after two years abroad.
 Switzerland.
 Geneva.
 Ugh.
 Yes.
 We have a house there.
 So, what's it like? Switzerland? No.
 Prep, silly.
 I think it's fine.
 I've been homeschooling for quite a while now, so I'm virtually a new boy, too.
 Then we shall brave it together.
  -  I'm just a gigolo  -  Gigolo  -  And everywhere I go  -  Gigolo, gigolo  -  People know the part I'm playing  -  Gigolo   Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo  -  Paid for every dance  -  Gigolo  -  Selling each romance  -  Gigolo  -  Oh, what they're saying  -  Gigolo, gigolo   Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo, gigolo   There will come a day when youth will pass away   Oop, what will they say about me?   When the end comes, I know   Life goes on without me  I was kind of expecting a restaurant.
 Miss Kringle, I'm so sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I should have been more clear.
 Uh, I like to cook.
  I'm a good cook.
 Is that okay? It is.
 It is.
 Um, and perhaps you should call me Kristen.
 Kristen.
  When the end comes, I know   They'll say just a gigolo   Life goes on without me.
   Hobbs' campaign office is the entire second floor.
 You sure about this? Don't worry.
 I've got it under control.
 Okay, you gotta tell me what the hell's going on.
 I know I gotta do whatever you say, but at least tell me why the hell we're doing it? They have my mother, Butch.
 Who? Galavan and his sister.
 They have her.
 They're making me do this.
 Holy smokes.
 We gotta find your mom.
 If they find out we're looking, they'll hurt her.
  Don't worry.
 We'll find her.
    He's here.
  Let's go.
 Got it.
 Thanks.
  I still think we should move you somewhere a little more secure.
 Forget it.
 Anyone has the guts to come after me They'll find out real soon who they're messin' with.
 Whoa-ho-ho Who the hell are you? Oh.
  I came here to volunteer.
  Well, run back to whoever hired you.
 Tell them I'm not going anywhere.
 This city needs me.
 Oh! Cool pins.
 Count, idiot.
 - There's five of us.
 - I know.
 Hardly seems fair.
 Move, move, move, move, move! Go! Aah!   Keep going! There you go.
 GCPD! Put down your weapons!  Fan out! Flank him from both sides, catch him in our crossfire.
 Yeah, do that.
 I'll cover you.
 Okay.
 So they move well.
 Aah!  Unexpected.
 Move! Move, move, move!   Let's go! -  - Shooter got away, sir.
  You just met Victor Zsasz.
 Works for Penguin these days.
 What the hell is Penguin playing at?   I love how your eyes close   No, but I I feel like, um, I owe you an apology.
 I feel as though I have been nothing but mean to you.
 No, I don't think that's fair.
 I feel like all I've ever done is is annoy you.
  - I've been consistently inappropriate.
 - No.
 No, no, no, no, it's me.
 You have been nothing but sweet, and I ignored your card and your your gift.
 Miss Kringle, I can honestly say that our interactions are always the highlight of my day.
 Please.
 Uh Kristen.
 Oh, my, God, I even accused you of writing Dougherty's good-bye note.
 Right.
  - Crazy.
 - I mean, oh who knows what that jerk was thinking? Jerk.
 How I ever let him lay a hand on me, I'll never know.
 I'm glad he's dead.
  If I've been told   Well, he's he just left town.
 - He's not dead.
 - Right, yeah, I know.
 Figure of speech.
 He's dead to you.
 Out of your life.
 Not dead, dead.
 Oh Um  I'm gonna use the restroom.
 You blew it, dummy.
 Nice work.
 - Leave me alone! - Are you talking to me? No.
 Honestly, Kristen, I wasn't talking to you.
 Who else is there? I talk to myself.
 It's crazy, I know.
 I just, I have this, um I have this voice inside my head, a sort of stronger version of me, that keeps this me in line, because I'm such a klutz.
 I can understand that.
 I think that we all have a voice like that.
 You think? What was your inner voice saying? He was mad at me for spoiling the mood.
 Mm-hmm.
 It was it was a really nice mood.
 But my inner voice is telling me that I think maybe we can get back there.
 -  -     You killed Caulfield.
 We have a witness.
 And the attempt on Galavan was that you, too? - Not now.
 - And Hobbs? - You sent Zsasz there? - It's complicated, okay? What does it profit you to mess with the election? You have your own sordid empire to rule over.
 Walk away, Jim.
 Let me be.
 The GCPD has new leadership.
 No more deals, no more favors.
 If they find out you're behind these attacks, - we will come after you with every - Rousing speech! Really! Goosebumps.
 But you came here alone, Jim, with no warrant, no cuffs, no backup, and why? Because you would hate for your new captain to find out about how you gunned down Ogden Barker in cold blood.
 Over a debt.
  A debt to me.
 He was trying to kill me.
 Where are your witnesses? And just that day before, I suppose you did not ask me to run Commissioner Loeb out of town so that you could get your old job back? I'll face whatever's coming to me.
 As will I.
 Good-bye, Jim.
 Obviously.
 I don't think so.
 - I'm serious.
 - Singed for a second.
 Hey, you shouldn't be joking about near misses.
 Next bullet might get stuck right in your eye.
 Yes, sir.
 No joking.
 All right, gather round.
 Today, I'm giving the strike force its first real mission.
 Build a case to put away Gotham's Enemy Number One.
 Time to take down The Penguin.
 Hey, Selina, come on, let's go.
 I don't know what you want with Master Bruce, but I'm certain that his life's gonna be a damn sight better without you in it.
 So, what do you think? Red? Or blue? - Red.
 - Blue.
 Blue it is.
 I want some fun.
 I'm sick of staying indoors.
 Patience, Barbara.
 Your time will come.
 The wheel is turning.
 While the GCPD chase The Penguin, I'll steal the mayor's office right from under their noses.
 Did you find her?      

                



                


                    			Previously on Gotham My name is Nathaniel Barnes.
 I'm your new boss.
 Sid Bunderslaw.
 I'm the director of physical operations.
 I've been expecting you.
 Garrett, Pinkney, - Josie, Martinez! - Congratulations.
 You are now Unit Alpha of the GCPD Strike Force.
 Time to take down the Penguin.
 Mother You'll pay for this! They die, your mother lives.
 I'm gonna need you to take a crack at me also and miss, of course.
 Get down! If the bad guys want to stop me running, well, then I guess I got no choice.
 I will run for mayor.
 Thank you for the trunk, old friend.
 I'll call you when I need you.
 I'm glad you call me a friend.
 Figure of speech.
 But do go on.
 I can't help feeling Wouldn't I be so much more useful to you as a friend? As a colleague, an ally? As opposed to the tool you are at present.
 Good question.
 No.
 I would be a much more effective tool for you if I wasn't so worried about my mother.
 If you let her come home, I would still do your bidding.
 Trust me, I know who's boss now.
 Lord have mercy.
 No need to rub it in.
 Yes, sir, we all know who's boss.
 What do you think, Tabitha? I wasn't listening.
 You know how I love the big macho type.
 - Leave him alone.
 - Yeah, leave me alone.
 Shh! The answer is no, old friend.
 Off you go.
 Stay by the phone.
 I wish you wouldn't freak out the help.
 I've got a mayoral campaign to run.
 I need to know you're gonna handle this part of the business.
 I get bored.
 I hate it when you say that.
 You have plenty to do.
 You still have Mayor James to play with.
 He's been here nearly a month.
 He's getting old fast.
 You got Barbara to hang out with.
 Yeah, she's cool, but she sleeps a lot.
 And she's kind of crazy.
 That's the best part about her.
 Galavan? - What the hell is going on? - Mr.
 Bunderslaw, welcome.
 What what do you want with me? You are the garbage man for Wayne Enterprises, correct? Every nasty little thing the company has done, you know all about it.
 - No.
 - Yes, and you are gonna tell us everything that you know.
 And if I refuse? Torture.
 But that's for later.
 Right now, there is something of yours we need to borrow.
 Sister, if you don't mind.
 Left or right? Either one.
 No God! Anybody who doesn't want to get shot, raise your hand! Get down! A damn rocket launcher? Welcome to Gotham, Cap.
 I can fit my yearly salary in my hands.
 Don't get any ideas about that cash, son.
 Just bag it up.
 Don't worry, sir.
 Ideas aren't his strong suit.
 Did some rough calculations, sir.
 Somewhere around two million dollars here.
 It's a strong body blow to Penguin.
 - He'll feel it.
 - Sir? They're asking for their pants.
 Read 'em their rights.
 Doesn't say squat about pants.
 Ah, wait.
 Tell 'em the whoever gives up where they got the damn rocket launcher gets to wear pants.
 The rest can go naked, for all I care.
 Captain.
 A word? There's a place called the Merc.
 Sells most of the heavy weapons in town.
 They haven't been hit, 'cause they pay off half the city council.
 The Merc, uh? The city council can suck my tailpipe.
 We're gonna hit this Merc tomorrow.
 Pinkney, belay that order.
 No one gets pants.
 We grab him up.
 We grab him, and we hurt him until he tells us where she is, and then we hurt him more.
 Okay, is that a good idea? Do you have a better one? - We could get the sister.
 - And then what? He's still out there, and does he love his sister as much as I love my mother? I don't think so! Hmm, it is a pickle.
 Mr.
 Penguin, sir, the cops just hit the count house.
 They took everything, every dollar.
 Ooh! Did you enjoy giving me that news?! Butch! I have an idea.
 Hey, you.
 Good morning.
 How's your day look? The strike force is going out on another raid.
 Strike force.
 I hate that name.
 Yeah, I'm not wild about it myself, but Barnes gets things done.
 He can call us what he likes.
 All right, so you go strike with your force, then what are we doing tonight? - Sleep.
 - Uh-uh, it's date night, mister.
 With who? Morning, Ed.
 Detective, Ms.
 Tompkins.
 As you may have heard, I've recently been seeing Miss Kringle.
 Kristen.
 And she mentioned that it might be nice to go out with other people along, so I thought, perhaps, the two of you would enjoy joining us for dinner tonight.
 - We can't.
 - We'd love to.
 Sure.
 Yeah, yeah, no.
 Great.
 As a matter of fact, I just bought some new fondue pots.
 - Why don't we do it at my house? - Excellent, excellent.
 I'll go tell Kristen.
 I know, I know, but it was the decent thing to do.
 Fondue? Have you ever tried it? It's delicious.
 It's at your place.
 We can't leave.
 We're already home.
 - Trapped.
 - Don't be mean.
 We'll make it fun.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Detective Gordon? Good morning.
 I wonder if we could, talk alone? Of course.
 Thank you for, giving me some of your valuable time.
 Oh, not a problem.
 That night at the gala, I I just keep going through it.
 Yeah.
 Me, too.
 I've never killed a man before.
 Fear blood I relive that moment over and over.
 Do those thoughts ever go away? No.
 But over time, they lose their power.
 You did the right thing.
 I guess I did.
 I'm kind of amazed at myself.
 You, doing the right thing, it's what you do every day.
 That's why people speak so highly of you.
 You're a symbol to the people of this city of hope, of honor.
 That's why I'm here.
 I would be honored if you would consider endorsing me for mayor.
 Ah, endorsement.
 I'm flattered, but, I'm afraid policemen and politics don't mix.
 Maybe not for the cop on the street, but you're the president of the Policeman's Union.
 Where you lead, officers will follow.
 That's more power than the kind that comes out of a gun.
 You seem like a good man, but I'm afraid my answer has to be no.
 I don't do endorsements.
 I know better than to push.
 But think about it.
 We could really help each other.
 Hi, Penguin.
 What do you want? Why so glum? - I just lost a lot of money.
 - Aww.
 Poor sad little bread head.
 The money is immaterial.
 Someone must have betrayed me.
 Someone close.
 You don't know that, boss.
 Oh, don't I? Don't I?! Whoa, chill, birdman.
 I got a job for you.
 What's that? Addresses of places you're gonna burn to the ground.
 Starting tonight.
 Arson now? Sure, fine.
 Whatever.
 If I can find a trustworthy arsonist.
 Paranoid, huh? Get your head together, little man, and get it done.
 Oh, and whoever starts the fires is gonna need this.
 Nice place.
 Whassup? I need you to take me to the Pike Brothers.
 The firebugs from the Narrows? I used to hang with their sister, Bridgit, when I was a kid.
 Why do you need me to take you? To vouch for me.
 The Pikes are the best arsonists in town, but they're also Fish loyalists.
 The idiots think she's coming back someday.
 She might come back.
 I was there, darlin'.
 - She might.
 - Whatever.
 The Pikes hate me and Penguin, for obvious reasons, but everyone knows Fish loved you.
 They do? Your face will open doors, babe.
 - Six hundred.
 - Three-fifty.
 Fine.
 Just let me do the talking.
 You just smile and make like we're friends.
 Friends? That's a hundred extra.
 Chiseler.
 So, everybody knows she loved me? That's what they say.
 She loved me, too, once.
 And I loved her.
 Then you shot her.
 It was complicated.
 Got that right.
 Hi, Bridgit.
 Hey, Selina.
 It's been a while.
 Me and my pet gorilla are here on business.
 Your brothers home? Yeah.
 Hey, boys.
 What are you doing with this rat, Selina? He's okay.
 I vouch for him.
 What do you mean, okay? The bastard shot Fish.
 It was complicated.
 He loves her just like you do.
 - And if she ever comes back - When she comes back.
 When she does, he will be right by her side.
 If she comes back? Sure.
 But she But right now, he got a nice job for you guys.
 Business is business, right? Hey, bygones, huh? We need the best, and you guys are the best.
 Easy.
 - That's a lot of work.
 - A lot of pay.
 You up for it? For sure.
 We'll need more gear.
 I'll hit the Merc and stock up.
 We've got enough gear to burn down Gotham twice.
 There's always room for more napalm.
 Thanks.
 Hey, sis What are you, a slob? We have company.
 What do we do when we have company? We get them a glass.
 Ding, ding, ding.
 Go and do it.
 Thank you, Bridgit.
 You're gonna need this.
 - Hey.
 - Hey.
 Looks like rain.
 Yeah, it does.
 I don't mind it.
 Cleans the streets anyhow.
 That's true.
 Anyway, take care of yourself, Bridgit.
 Be strong.
 Yeah, can we get a price check on brass knuckles in toxic green? Thank you kindly.
 Try our Whiff-Away.

 Robbery.
 mouthpiece and muzzle guard.
 GCPD! Everybody on the ground! This is a raid! Runner! I got him! Stop! Stop right now! What the hell are you packing? When cheese melts, the protein matrix relaxes and the fats flow more like liquid.
 It creates this low-friction mouth feel, which is why melted cheese is so Ed.
 - Uh, it's delicious.
 - Mm-hmm.
 Yes, it is.
 Oh, no! Oh, Lee, we shouldn't be eating without Jim here.
 - I'm so sorry.
 - No, no, no, please, eat.
 It's fine.
 There he is.
 - Hello, there.
 - Hey, Jim.
 Nice to see you.
 Sorry I'm late.
 Really sorry.
 Long story.
 I hope it hasn't been going too bad.
 You know, it's the weirdest thing, but Nygma's actually maintaining this strange sort of cool.
 No.
 Seriously.
 There's a lid for every pot.
 Pardon me.
 Since Detective Gordon is here, I'd like to propose a toast.
 The less you have, the more they're worth.
 To friends.
 Hear, hear.
 I can't believe he's dead.
 Biggest job of our lives, and this happens.
 So what do we do? For sure, we do the job.
 How? We're screwed.
 Who's our entry man now? Crawling through air vents? Climbing fire escapes? We need a little skinny guy.
 You think? Hey, Bridgy you just got a promotion.
 - No.
 - Yes.
 Please, you know I don't like fire.
 You don't like fire? Fire is our bread and butter.
 It's our family business.
 You're don't want to let down your family, do you? You're not my family.
 What's that? We're not your family? - You got anybody else? - My mother Your mother was a ho, and she's dead.
 Who feeds you? Who puts a roof above your head? Huh? We do.
 That's family.
 - I won't do it.
 - Oh.
 Fine, be like that.
 But if you're not family, well, that changes things around here, though.
 See, I'm a decent guy.
 I would never put family on the street.
 But if you're not family Hell why not make a buck? Yo, that's a kick-ass idea.
 So what are you gonna do? Hm? Do you want to be turned out? Or do you want to be family? Which? Family.
 He wanted me to endorse him for mayor.
 Wow.
 What did you say? I said no.
 You don't like him? I do, actually.
 But I know better than to let that matter.
 Endorsing politicians that's not me.
 Still, he asked you.
 That's very flattering.
 You're a respected figure in this town.
 The way people look at you, see you differently, you treat it like it's a burden.
 It could be a source of pride, or happiness even, if you let it.
 Thank you, Doctor.
 - Same time next week? - Oh Don't tempt me.
 I could psychoanalyze the heck out of you.
 But I'm gonna resist the urge.
 Gee, thanks.
 Be strong, Bridgit.
 Okay.
 - It's on.
 - Now you're gonna want to cut yourself about a foot and a half of fuse.
 Okay.
 Push the wick into the plastic explosive.
 Okay.
 Now get out the flame.
 You got about a minute and a half to get out of there once that fuse is lit.
 Spark it up.
 - It's lit.
 - Okay, great.
 Sorry, there's one more thing to do.
 - But it's lit! - Well, you'd better haul ass.
 Do you see a safe on your right? Yeah.
 - Get to it.
 - Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay, now grab the box at the bottom of the bag and open it up.
 Oh, my God.
 Grody, right? Okay, put it to the sensor next to the door.
 Welcome, Mr.
 Bunderslaw.
 Okay.
 It's open.
 Now what? Joe? Joe, where are you? Joe, what's wrong? I'm just messing with you.
 Okay, so there should be an old knife there.
 Grab it.
 Okay.
 - Got it.
 - Okay, now scram.
 Attagirl.
 You did good, sis.
 Get in the van, chop chop.
 I burned my leg.
 Well, you play with fire, you get burned, all of that.
 We got four more of these to do tonight, so get in the damn van.
 Five locations, all burned to the ground.
 Yeah, Garrett? Excuse me, sir.
 Lab called in, said the fires were started with thermite and high-end accelerants.
 So we're looking for professional arsonists.
 Thanks.
 And, Garrett, nice work yesterday.
 Thank you, sir.
 Strange.
 Why would a pro do five jobs in one night? - What's the rush? - And what if they're not done? Find a pattern to these fires.
 Before they burn down the whole city.
 What are you doing? Hi.
 Making a suit, so I won't get burned again.
 Why would you get burned again? So they're making you start the fires? I guess.
 Sit down.
 You want a soda or something? No, I-I can't, I'm supposed to take that to Penguin.
 Okay.
 You know, you're gonna get yourself killed.
 I'll be careful.
 Well, careful ain't enough.
 Look what happened already.
 It was exciting, Selina.
 I actually kind of enjoyed it.
 Yep, you're gonna be bacon.
 My brother said I did a good job.
 - It's the family business.
 - They're not your family.
 Your mom used to bang their old man is all.
 You don't need them.
 You don't need anybody.
 Look at me I'm free.
 I remember when I was little and you showed up at the Narrows.
 You looked for your mom every day.
 Snot all down your face from crying.
 So don't act like you don't want a family.
 - Don't talk about my mom.
 - Who cares if you're free? What good's freedom if you're alone? What good's family if you're a slave? Huh? Whatever.
 I don't even know why you think I care.
 Doesn't make any sense.
 This is the Wayne family crest.
 So what? Why does Galavan want an antique knife that belonged to the Waynes? There's something here, something to understanding Galavan, to beating him.
 Well, if you want to know about old-time Gotham, talk to Edwige.
 - Edwige? - Yeah.
 She runs the antique shop in my old neighborhood.
 Trust me.
 She knows things.
 You can pick it up if you like.
 That's okay.
 Sorry.
 I can't help you.
 Edwige, I can see that you know this knife.
 You're scared of this knife.
 Why? - Why are you lying to me? - I'm not.
 Madam, if there's one thing I know, it's a liar.
 Now, tell me about this knife, or I will use it.
 This knife has a cursed history.
 Almost 200 years ago, it was used in a terrible crime.
 Back then five families ruled Gotham high society.
 The Elliots, the Kanes, the Crownes, the Dumas and the most powerful of them all the Waynes.
 They called Celestine Wayne the crown jewel of Gotham.
 A real beauty.
 She was promised to the eldest son of the Elliot family.
 But there was another who coveted her.
 Caleb Dumas.
 One night it was during an Easter party at the Wayne Manor Celestine and Caleb went missing.
 Wayne men found them together in an illicit embrace.
 - Caleb insisted that they were in love - We're in love! And Celestine swore on her mother's grave that Caleb had forced himself on her.
 - I'm innocent.
 Celestine! - Justice, - if that's what it was, was swift.
 - I'm telling the truth! Celestine's brother Jonathan Wayne delivered the punishment.
 The Waynes they were mad with rage.
 They seized the Dumas' holdings and banished them socially, destroyed them.
 Caleb Dumas went into exile overseas, to a penitential religious sect founded by his family's patron saint.
 Celestine died an old maid.
 The Waynes forbade the press from even mentioning the Dumas.
 They renamed streets and buildings.
 The remnants of the Dumas family were forced to change their name.
 The Waynes wiped the Dumas out of our city's history.
 Those remnants of the Dumas family to what did they change their name? Aren't you quick? Galavan.
 They changed their name to Galavan.
 Just like that fella runnin' for mayor.
 And that's why I'm scared of this knife.
 You're in deep waters, Mr.
 Penguin.
 Thank you, Edwige.
 That is where penguins thrive.
 You hear anything about any fires, you come see me, earn yourself a get out of jail free card, all right? You got a look on your face.
 Wayne Enterprises.
 The arsonists moved east to west.
 If they come out tonight and stick to pattern, there's one obvious target, an old building also owned by Wayne Enterprises Gotham City Book Depository.
 Yay.
 Stakeout.
 I'll buy the doughnuts.
 Just no chili dogs this time, huh? I'll let Barnes know the plan.
 Sent the knife to Galavan.
 Your favorite, isn't it? Crosswhite, 20 year.
 That's the stuff, all right.
 Have a taste.
 Nah, I'm good right now.
 But thanks.
 Have a drink, Butch.
 Your conditioning is still working nicely, hmm? You can't refuse me.
 You're the only man I can truly trust right now.
 Starting to sound a little paranoid, boss.
 Am I? Am I going mad? How could I not when that fiend has my mother in his clutches? Have another drink, Butch.
 Maybe I am going mad.
 Or maybe I found Galavan's weakness.
 You did? The knife, Butch.
 The knife that maimed his ancestor.
 This is a blood feud for Galavan.
 He wants revenge against the Waynes.
 He's acting out of emotion.
 And that can be manipulated.
 Have another drink.
 You are going to go to Galavan and you're going to tell him I went nuts and that I accused you of setting up the count shop raid.
 You are in fear for your life, and you need a job, got that? Yes, boss.
 Once you're inside his organization, you will find my mother and rescue her.
 Yes, boss.
 But Galavan's a smart guy, and that's a basic play.
 No way is he gonna buy I turned traitor.
 No.
 But he will buy that I think you turned traitor.
 He'll buy it if we sell it right.
 Drink up.
 How do we sell it? I already sold him my paranoia.
 But you're the closer.
 How do we sell you? How do we make him trust and feel for you? I wasn't sure.
 But then Celestine and Caleb told me how.
 How? It's the onions that bring it together.
 The sweetness and the acid, am I right? I hate stakeouts.
 Half of good police work is the ability to sit on one's ass when it's called for.
 If that were true, you'd be commissioner.
 Har-dee, har-har.
 Heads up.
 All units stand by.
 We may have something.
 Roger.
 So it's all old books in there, so this one's easy.
 Just spread the napalm around, spark that thing up and go to town.
 Zero sweat.
 This thing scares me.
 Yeah, it's a flamethrower, it's meant to be scary.
 Get suited up and get this done.
 We got three more spots to hit.
 All units converge on our location.
 Now.
 Moving in.
 - GCPD! - Run! Go, go, go! Gray van leaving the alley.
 Get back! Please! Get back! Drop it! Put down the weapon! - Drop the weapon! - I got her! - Drop it.
 - No! - Garrett, no! - Let me go! Let go of it! No! Let go of me! Garrett! I got him, I got him.
 I need an ambulance! Officer down! Bridgit! Bridgit! Come on, hurry! Quick, follow me! - Where are we going? - Home.
 Thanks.
 - Any news? - Not yet.
 But he's a tough kid, I bet you he makes it.
 Your buddy's here.
 Can't stop pressing the flesh.
 Real publicity hound.
 There's no cameras here.
 Your attention, please.
23 a.
m.
 - Damn it.
 It ain't right.
 Burned to death in an alley by some weirdo.
 - He was gonna be a great cop.
 - He was a great cop.
 And we will mourn him.
 But not now.
 There is a cop killer on the loose.
 I cannot abide that.
 We will find the person who killed our brother, and we will put a stop to them using every legal method at our disposal.
 Excuse me.
 Your fellow officer is dead, I can see it in your face.
 He is.
 I'm sorry to hear it.
 The bad guys in this town are changing.
 They're not playing by the old rules.
 Or any rules.
 We need every method at our disposal.
 And I'm not just talking about more guns.
 You need to go where you need to go, press who you need the press and have the city back your play.
 Correct.
 I don't know how bad it's gonna get.
 But if you can give me your word we won't have to face it alone you'll have my endorsement.
 I promise you, you'll have whatever you need.
 Father Creel.
 Theo.
 It's been a long time.
 You look well.
 As do you.
 You've surrounded yourself with luxury.
 Well, I have to play the part, Father, and as you'll see it's paying off.
 Still sharp after all these years.
 You have the Wayne boy? Not yet.
 There are some practical matters that have to be resolved first.
 A few pieces to arrange on the board before the checkmate.
 But soon.
 After almost 200 years, we can be patient.
 The day of redemption is at hand.
 Our brothers are crossing the ocean even now.
 Warriors like this city has never known.
 Gotham will be redeemed in blood.
 And Bruce Wayne will die.
   

                



                


                    			 Previously on Gotham How I ever let him lay a hand on me  I'm glad he's out of your life.
 Keep that guard up jab, jab.
 Lead jab, jab, right.
 - What you doing? - Alfred's teaching me to fight.
 I need you to take me to the Pike brothers.
 The firebugs from the Narrows? I used to hang with their sister, Bridgit.
 Hey, boys.
 We need the best and you guys are the best.
 Bridgy, you just got a promotion.
 One moment, Mr.
 Penguin.
 Mother.
 I don't know nothing.
 You are going to go to Galavan.
 Once you're inside his organization, you will find my mother and rescue her.
 He'll buy it if we sell it right.
  And then Penguin just went crazy.
 I mean, like crazier than I've ever seen him.
 He said it was me that set up the count house raid, said I was a traitor and a rat.
  Then he he came at me with a cleaver.
 I tried to protect myself and he did this.
  Sick bastard.
 Hmm.
 There was a lot of blood.
 A lot.
 And he he tried to take another swing and he slipped and fell and so I just ran.
 I ran and I ran and then the next thing I knew, I woke up in the hospital.
 Huh.
 Give me a shot, Mr.
 Galavan.
 Let me show you what I can do.
 Well, I'd like to help you out, Butch, but I already have several capable, two-handed thugs in my employ.
 They don't know Gotham like I do.
 I got brains, you ask anyone.
 What do you think, ladies? I think he's cute.
 Like a sad bear.
 I suppose he's telling the truth.
 The little man was cracking up last time I saw him.
 He was very mean to me once.
 Held me hostage in my own apartment.
 Said some nasty things.
 Isn't that right, stumpy? That's right, ma'am.
 And I'm sorry for it.
 Business is business, you know? Please.
 Let me work for you, Mr.
 Galavan.
 I got nobody else to turn to.
  Oh, yes! We can put cool things on his stump, like knives and mallets and stuff.
 Ooh! How about a little tiny chain saw? - Yes.
 - Huh.
 Well, that settles it.
 - Welcome aboard, Butch.
 - Thank you, sir.
 Oh!  Oh.
 Bravo, Congressman.
 Well saved.
 You really are quite spry for a big man.
 Have you reconsidered your position? Can I count on your support this election? Yes.
 Yes, you have my full support.
 Thank you so much.
    Freeze! Man, I didn't do nothing! Why you chasing me? A police officer died last night, killed by a firebug crew on a spree.
 You're a firebug, aren't you? No, man! I been out of the game a long time!  - Don't lie to me, Nino! - I swear! Sir, that's a violation of officer conduct regs.
 Luke Garrett burned to death in front of me 12 hours ago.
 I'll conduct myself as I see fit.
 This crew's working with a kid.
 A girl.
 Wears a homemade fire suit.
 Hey, for real! Never heard of a female firebug before.
 It's mad rare, like a like a unicorn or something.
   Sir? Captain Barnes says we must report any infractions.
 - Even by superior officers.
 - You do that.
 What are you doing? Can't sleep.
 I don't know what to do with myself.
  That's the point of being free.
 You get to do whatever the hell you want.
 What am I gonna do? I killed someone last night.
 I can't go home.
 I can't go to the police - You gotta get out of town.
 - How? I got no money.
 No problem.
 We'll get some.
 You mean, like, crime?  Man, you are square.
  I guess I got no choice.
 Why are you helping me? Maybe you remind me of me.
 If I was a doofus.
 Ladies and gentlemen! Or should I say, pimps, hoes and thieves! Do I have some product for you today! - Do you like what you see? -  Come on, now let me hear you! Do you like what you see?!  All right.
 Oh, check it out, check it out! Yeah, it's nice and it's dirty! I want her! Bidding will start at $800.
 Apiece.
 Have we got $800? Come on! $850!  Those girls are for sale? Told you this place was freaky.
 We need to help them.
 We're here to help you.
 'Cause you killed a cop, remember? We get the money, we go.
 - But - Listen! Listen.
 You go down the stairs.
 The lock on the back door is busted.
 I know, 'cause I busted it.
 You go in, wait for me to make my move.
 How will I know when? Pay attention.
 Sold for $2,500 to the gentleman in the burgundy hat! Come on, ladies.
 Found you a nice new home! Oh, you'll be very satisfied.
 Very, very satisfied.
 Next up! Check her out as she walks down the stage; see how graceful she is.
 Hey, pervs! This is a robbery! Milo! Kill that punk.
 She's with me.
 Now, each of you put all your cash in the bag.
 Or what? I ain't scared of you.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Anybody else got a problem? Yeah, didn't think so.
  And for the record? All y'all suck.
 Oh, my God.
 I know, right? Let's go.
 A note in my file? Are you serious? Do I look like I'm joking? We do not beat suspects! Ever!  I get it.
 Luke was a good kid.
 We took him out of the academy, told him he was ready.
 Now he's dead.
 You lose people in war.
 You know that.
 Make no mistake, this is war.
 But that doesn't give you or me the license to break the law.
 There's a line.
 I learned that the hard way.
 Respectfully, sir, this is Gotham.
 There are gray areas.
 I've learned that the hard way, too.
 And did you even get a lead while you were out avenging Luke? - No, sir.
 - No, sir? Well, you got one now.
 Bodega owner called this in.
 His security camera caught it.
 She's our firefly.
 We don't know who the other one is.
  I do.
 Damn it.
  Focus.
 Focus! Head down! Head down! Distractions will be the death of you, Master Bruce.
 Now, get on your toes.
 On your toes.
 Move! Well, don't dance around like a bloody showgirl.
 - Come on.
 -  That's better.
 Better.
 Now, big left, big left.
 Go on! I got you.
 Now, your enemies.
 Are gonna fight a lot dirtier than that.
 Ow.
 Ow!  Bloody hell.
  Very good, Master Bruce.
 Eh? Have you spoken to Mr.
 Fox about the computer? That I have, yeah.
 How much longer until it's fixed? I'll tell you when it's done, won't I? Patience.
 I'm tired of patience, Alfred.
 I'm ready to begin.
 I'll tell you when you're ready, Master Bruce.
 I'm ready now.
 I know I am.
 Oh, by the way, by the way, Miss Silver called.
 She wants you to go for dinner this evening.
 - Silver called? - Yeah.
  Told ya.
 Not ready.
 Let's go.
 Well, he just up and moved out of town.
 It was rude and inconsiderate and perfectly in character for Tom Dougherty.
 Do you ever wonder where he went? He could be dead in a ditch for all I care.
 - Kristen.
 - And I mean it, too.
 He, um he wasn't very nice to me.
 That's awful.
 - I'm so sorry.
 - Thank you.
 But it all worked out for the best.
 I know.
 You and Ed seem to be getting along.
  He is so gentle and kind.
 Almost too gentle.
 I-I think a man needs to have a little a little fire, a little danger in him, don't you think? Oh, I don't know about that.
  And sometimes I-I feel like he's holding something back from me.
 Like a secret? I don't know.
 I just I guess I just wish he would open up a little more.
 Good morning.
 Miss Kringle, Miss Thompkins.
 Hi.
 What do you call a three-legged cow? - I am terrible - Lean beef.
 Or supper.
 At my place.
 Oh Ed.
 - Aw.
 -  Ginger to ginger, we both know you know where Selina Kyle's at, so why don't you tell me now and save us the hassle.
 Who's Selina Kyle? - Cat.
 - Cat? Look, Ivy, want me to call the children's home and have 'em come get you now? Or should I get a candy bar and forget to have someone watch you? Candy bar.
 I struck out.
 None of the street kids I talked to have seen Selina.
 Relax.
 Your Uncle Harvey has you covered.
 She's in a squat off Jenkins.
 Condemned SRO.
 I know it.
 Hey.
 Last time we saw this chick, she had a shotgun pointed at us.
 Maybe you should take the Fascist Youth, huh? Nah.
 With Selina, it's best to go quietly.
 When you get to the bus station, take the first bus south.
 Stay on till the end of the line.
 Well, what do I do then? You got plenty of money.
 You can do what you like.
 Thank you.
 For everything.
 You've been a really good friend.
 I got my cut.
  No biggie.
   Bridgit, you need to run.
 Help me!  Hey!  Hands in the air! - Drop the gun.
 - Like hell I will.
 - Where's your girlfriend? - Who? We got both of you on tape.
 Don't know what you're talking about, Gordon.
 She's burnt down half a dozen buildings.
 Killed a cop.
 You're running with a bad partner, kid.
 You don't understand.
 She was forced to do all of that.
 Okay.
 Let me help her.
 Who is she? Who's forcing her to do this? Look, there's a lot of angry cops out there.
 She's gonna get shot on sight, unless I get to her first.
 Her name is Bridgit Pike.
 Her brothers took her back.
 Joe and Cale Pike.
 They, like kidnapped her.
 They're the ones who made her start burning stuff in the first place.
 It's their fault the cop died.
 The Pike brothers? Why'd they burn down Wayne Enterprises' buildings? - Who paid them? - Why the hell should I know why the Pikes do anything? They're freakin' nuts.
 They treated Bridgit like a slave, chained her to the wall.
 And you're angry about it.
 Is that why you're armed? You're gonna go after the Pikes? Rescue your friend? - No.
 - That's a yes.
 Look, you're gonna get your friend and yourself killed.
 - Let me handle the Pikes.
 - No offense, Jim, but I like my chances better than yours.
 Why get involved? Why risk your neck? Who is this girl to you? No one.
 Just a girl in the neighborhood.
 I give you my word.
 I will do everything I can to keep her safe.
 But you have to stay out of it.
 Tell me where she is.
  Damn.
 She's got six grand here.
 Little Bridgy put on her big girl pants.
 You can take all of it.
 I don't care.
 Oh, I'm taking it.
 That's not the issue.
 Oh, snap.
 - Bridgit's gonna get it.
 - Joe, please.
 Did you even think about us, hmm? Did you even think how we would feel? -  - No, don't! Joe, I didn't mean anything by it! I'm a sensitive guy, and you hurt my feelings.
 -  -  You know, without family, what do you got? You-you got nothin', right? You want to be part of the family again? -  -  I said do you feel like being part of this family again?  Yes! -  - Damn!  Damn, that hurts.
 - Bridgit's back.
 -   If you try anything like that again, I'll kill you, and I'll skin that little cat bitch, too.
 You hear me? You're never leaving.
 - Yes.
 - Good.
 Go make our supper.
 All right, let's pack it up.
  Dear me.
 A mallet.
 That's, um useful.
 Don't even start.
 Tell me you bring good news.
 I'm in.
 - I'm in good.
 - And? And?! I'm asking questions.
 But it's dangerous.
 If I push too hard, Galavan'll be onto me.
 I told you, he's a smart guy.
 Look at me, Butch.
 Are you my servant?  Yes.
 Do you obey me in all things? Yes.
 Then why do you bring me excuses? Go find my mother.
 Before I chop off your other hand.
 -  - Yes, boss.
 Come on.
 Harder.
   Come on, Joe.
 What are you gonna do, kill us? Yep.
  - Oh, God! -   I'll check the other room.
   - Clear! -  - She's not here.
 - Damn.
 I hate how it smells like good barbecue.
 -  -  Bitch.
  Bullock, hey! What?! Scared the hell out of me!  And now he's dead.
 - Nice work, Bullock.
 - Oh, yeah.
 My kicks did it? Maybe it's because he's fried like a taquito! - It's not on me.
 - Uh-huh.
 Looks like Selina was telling the truth.
 Look, I don't want to speak ill of the dead, but these asshats had it coming.
 These asshats were professional arsonists.
 Somebody hired them.
 - Why Wayne Enterprises? - Who cares, all right? There's a freaky firefly chick on the loose with a flamethrower.
 Let's start there.
   Hallelujah.
 Hello, Butch.
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 I just wanted to check in, see how things were going.
 Any complaints? No.
 No, sir.
 I'm fine like a bottle of wine.
 -  - Good.
 You have a real future here.
 You are a hard worker, and you're loyal to a fault.
 Thank you, boss.
 If only you were loyal to me.
 I, uh I don't know what you're talking about.
 Come on, Butch.
 Have some dignity.
 I know what you were doing.
 You were looking for Penguin's mother, weren't you? The hand was a nice touch.
 Almost fooled me.
 How on earth did Penguin get you to do that? I'm his servant.
 I have to obey him in all things.
 Penguin's done a number on you, huh? Tinkered with your wiring.
 Perhaps we can help.
 Tabby? Tabby, could you come here, please? Penguin has brainwashed this poor soul.
 - Can we help? - Be my pleasure.
 All right, let-let's let's talk about this.
 Can we talk about this? Take it easy.
 What are you doing? Relax.
 We just want to help.
 I'll leave you two to it.
 Uh, remember, dinner's in an hour.
   We've set up a perimeter.
 She can't have gotten far.
 And we're sitting on Selina Kyle's place.
 Keep me posted.
 Bridgit Pike was abused her whole life, forced to set those fires.
 I promised my informant I would keep her safe.
 Uh, weren't you the one saying that Luke Garrett was just a kid? That we owe him justice? - I know that's what I said.
 - And you were right.
 And now she killed him.
 Now she has two more dead bodies on her.
 So I don't care about the hows and the whys and the boo-hoos.
 You don't make promises you can't keep.
 You find her and you take her down.
 - Clear? - Yes, sir.
  We must've spent years up here, watching these birds.
 Remember when Mickey Slattery called us orphan bastards and we tried to throw him off the roof? The cops are outside my place.
 - You need to get out of town.
 - I'm not scared of them.
 Bridgit, I know what you did to your brothers.
 Not that they didn't deserve it, but - Whoa.
 - I was surprised.
 Cale flamed up good, but it was Joe who burned the brightest.
 - You don't sound like yourself.
 - I'm not myself anymore.
 I'm free.
 Just like you told me I was.
 So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna go after the rest of them.
 - The rest of who? - The pervs and the bullies.
 The ones who hurt people like us.
 No one's ever gone after me or hurt me.
 Yeah, right.
 look after number one.
 That's you.
 Don't be crazy, or you'll get yourself killed.
 Don't worry about me, Selina.
 - This is what I was meant to do.
 - Bridgit, please, don't do this.
 It's nice to have someone who cares about me.
 Thank you.
 I don't care.
 I just think you're being dumb.
 But Hey Good luck.
 I'll see you around.
 A toast.
 I'm so sorry.
 Something came up last minute.
 To family.
 In the end, it's all that matters.
 Family.
 I hope, in time, you'll come to think of us as family, Bruce.
 Thank you.
 It's-it's been some time since I had a - a meal like this.
 - You mean with girls? You should come over more often.
 We can, like, hang out or whatever.
 I'd like that.
 Look how cute they are.
 Don't you just want to eat them? Tabitha, leave the young people alone.
 Well, they are cute.
 And they know it.
 These were the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.
 I swear, I'm gonna get plump.
 I like that you have an appetite.
 Stop it, you're spoiling me.
 I won't stop it.
 I want nothing more than to spoil you.
 Oh.
 Ed.
 So forceful.
 There's something else I want to tell you.
 I just I don't want to scare you away.
 Please, tell me anything.
 Do not hold back.
  That sugar baby of mine   Kristen I like you very much.
 I I feel the same way about you.
 - And, um - And Shh.
 -  -  trips to his lips   If I was a bee   Because he's sweeter than   Sugar candy to me   He's confectionary sugar  Mr.
 Nygma, is that your bedroom over there?  I'm too sweet on my sugar   That sugar baby of mine  Why, yes, it is.
  That sugar baby of mine!    Gordon, phone call for you.
 - This is Gordon.
 - Do you remember your promise? Yes.
 I think I know where she's going.
 Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Go, go! Go!  Come on!   All right, no one gets hurt tonight.
 We follow protocols and stay safe.
 Yes, sir.
 Freeze! Hands in the air! Hold your fire! Bridgit Pike! Stay away! My name's Jim Gordon.
 I know what your brothers did to you.
  I know you didn't mean for any of this to happen.
 You don't know anything! You put your weapon down and come with me, I can help you.
 There are places you can go.
 I'm not going to jail! You're a juvenile.
 We can work something out.
 - Wait, wait! - I said hold your fire! Bridgit! Stop! Take cover! Bridgit! Wait!  I'm glad we have a moment alone.
 There is something I need to discuss.
 Oh.
 Sid Bunderslaw.
 Do you know him? Yes.
 We've met several times.
 - What happened? - No one knows.
 But it doesn't look good.
 How did you hear? Let's just say I have friends in high places, and I've been following the goings-on at Wayne Enterprises very closely.
 What have you learned? That your father was a good man.
 A great man, even.
 But in spite of that, bad things happened at his company.
 Unfortunately, I think you're right.
 I can tell you're very mature for your age.
 Ready to tackle the problems of your company head-on.
 But you'll need help.
 Once I'm mayor, I would very much like to be that person.
 Thank you Mr.
 Galavan.
 I-I appreciate it.
  Butch.
 - What has happened? - I found your mother.
 - Where? - In a warehouse down by the port.
 But they caught me looking.
 You half-wit! If they kill my mother! Look, they don't know I'm here.
 The tigerlady, she wanted to take her time with me, so she chained me up and I got out.
 We gotta go now.
  Yes.
 Yes, yes.
 Good, Butch.
 You've done well.
 Your loyalty will be rewarded handsomely.
 - I swear it.
 - Yes, boss.
 Rest here for a minute, and I'll go gather the troops.
 How old are you? Old enough to shoot you, if that's what you're thinking.
 No, that's not what I was thinking.
 You don't have to point the gun at me.
 I'm not gonna hurt you.
 Damn right you're not.
 - My name is Lee.
 - I know what your name is.
 What's your name? You're cute.
 For a doctor.
 Thanks.
 You're cute.
 For a gangster.
 Hi, Selina.
 Sorry about this, Lee.
 Oh, hey, no problem.
  So is Bridgit okay? I'm sorry.
 She's not gonna make it.
 You said that you'd help her.
 I tried, Selina.
 I tried.
 But she didn't want to go quietly.
 I think she wanted it to end this way.
 Look - Selina - Don't touch me.
 Don't touch me.
 I know you were telling the truth about Bridgit.
 That her brothers put her up to this.
 I need to know who hired them.
 I already told you I don't know.
 - And I still don't believe you.
 - What do you care? You don't care about people like us.
 It's not like you're really gonna go after your little friend.
 My friend? Do you mean Penguin? Why would he set those fires? - That doesn't make any sense.
 - Ask him yourself.
 I'm done talking to you.
 I should have never trusted a cop.
 I tried to help her, it just went a different way.
 Is that what you call it when someone dies? Is that what you tell yourself? I'm sorry.
  Whatever.
 You're so sweet.
 Kristen, what's the matter? Um I'm scared.
 - Of what? - Of Tom Dougherty.
 He used to tell me if he ever saw me with another man, he would kill me.
 I'm terrified of what will happen when he comes back.
 You don't need to worry about that.
 No you don't know him.
 He is  a monster.
 Listen to me.
 You do not need to worry about Tom Dougherty.
 You are sweet.
 But you're not a fighter.
 You couldn't possibly take him on.
 Trust me, it's been taken care of.
 What does that mean? Um Some time ago, he and I had an altercation.
 I asked him to treat you with more respect.
 Oh, my God.
 And he said he would treat you any way he liked and he assaulted me.
 - Oh, my God! - So, anyhow, long story short I killed him.
 Oh, Ed, that's You had me going for a minute, there.
 It was outside of your apartment under the elevated train.
 I stabbed him and he died.
 - Ed, that's not funny.
 - I'm not being funny.
 T.
 Dougherty.
 Do you believe me now? Oh, my God.
 - What's wrong? - Uh - How could you? - Where are you going? - No, please, sit down.
 - Don't touch me! - Would you please let me explain? - There is nothing to explain.
 I don't even know who you are.
 - No, that's wrong.
 - You are a murderer.
 He was a monster! You said so! He was abusing you.
 I can't believe I even fell for you, you sicko.
 I'm not sick.
 I love you.
 I did it for you.
 Everything I ever thought about you, I was right.
 - I should have my head examined.
 - Don't say that.
 Wait, what were you doing outside my house? I was worried for you.
 You were stalking me.
 You are a psychopath.
 That is not true! That's not who I am.
 - Don't say that about me.
 - You are going to prison where they will do horrible things to you.
 - Things that you deserve.
 - Don't say that to me.
 - No, let go.
 Don't touch me! -  - Let go of me, you freak.
 - Please don't call me that.
 Oh! Help! Listen to me.
 I am not the man that you think I am.
 I would never do anything to hurt you.
 I had to kill him because he hit you.
 Do you understand that? I did it for you.
 I promise I will never do anything to hurt you ever again.
 I love you.
 I've loved you since the first moment that I saw you.
 Kristen? Kristen? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no.
 Oh, no, plea Oh, no.
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 Please.
 Please, no.
 No.
 No.
 Damn, this girl looks rough.
 They tell people she dead.
 But that's a lie.
 I heard the suit she was wearing melted to her.
 - Say she's fireproof.
 - Come on.
 Yeah, man fireproof.
 That's why they sent her down here, with the rest of the monsters.
 For testing.
      

                



                


                    			- Previously, on Gotham - That's for Reggie.
 Now, I don't know what you want with Master Bruce, but I'm certain that his life's gonna be a damn sight better without you in it.
 I would be honored if you would consider - endorsing me for mayor.
 - If you can give me your word that we won't have to face it alone, you'll have my endorsement.
 It's been some time since I've had a meal like this.
 You should come over more often.
 We can, like, hang out or whatever.
 I'd like that.
 Let go of me, you freak! Listen to me.
 I did it for you.
 Kristen? I've been following the goings-on at Wayne Enterprises.
 - What have you learned? - That your father was a good man.
 But in spite of that, bad things happened at his company.
 Looking for Penguin's mother, weren't you? I have to obey him in all things.
 Penguin has brainwashed this poor soul.
 Can we help? I'll leave you two to it.
 Father Creel.
 - You have the Wayne boy? - Not yet, but soon.
 - I found your mother.
 - Where? In a warehouse down by the port.
 You sure this is it? I'm sure, boss.
 Once my mother is safe, we go after Galavan and his sister.
 They're gonna pay for what they've done.
 Mother! Mother.
 You're okay.
 Thank God.
 Oswald? Is that really you? Your sweet face.
 Like a vision.
 I'm taking you home, okay? Oh! And there I was, thinking you understood the meaning of consequences.
 Consequences, yes.
 I assure you that my understanding of consequences will be made quite clear once my mother is outside.
 But we've had so much fun together.
 My sister gets attached to her playthings, so I must insist she stay.
 And those bolt cutters are useless.
 The only way out of there is with this.
 Very well.
 Butch? Shoot them both in the head and grab the key.
 - Oswald? - Mother, I'm sorry, but what they've done to you will not stand! I gave you an order! Shoot them both in the head.
 No.
 No, no, no, that's not possible.
 You have to obey me.
 You have to! That time has passed.
 They fixed me.
 Tabby is well-versed in the protocols of conditioning.
 There's always a trigger word implanted during the process.
 All I had to do was get Butch remember what it is.
 I'll admit, it took a few tries.
 And now here we are.
 Please.
 I can still be valuable.
 You'll see.
 I so wish that were true.
 Then kill me if you must, but let her go.
 I'm begging you.
 Doesn't look like begging to me.
 Indeed, half-hearted at best.
 Please.
 I'll do anything.
 Perhaps she has served her purpose.
 Don't pout.
 You still have the former mayor.
 He's so dull.
 He just moans all the time.
 I told you everything would be okay.
 Didn't I? And it will be.
 No! No! Oswald? What is wrong? You look so sad.
 Nothing's wrong, Mother.
 Nothing at all.
 We're together now.
 That's all that matters.
 That's all that ever mattered, right? Ever since you were a little baby.
 My little Cobblepot.
 I'm sorry.
 This is my fault.
 Please forgive me.
 I'm so sorry.
 For what? You were always such a good boy.
 No, no.
 Kill him.
 Dump the bodies anywhere.
 You don't have the stomach to kill me yourself? No wonder your family was run out of town.
 You come from a long line of cowards! Fine, fine.
 Any last words? Yes.
 I'm going to kill you.
 You are a psychopath! I am not the man you think I am! I would never do anything to hurt you.
 Rise and shine.
 What are you doing here? I banished you for good.
 Almost.
 Love of a good woman and all of that.
 Though, we both know how that turned out.
 Yikes.
 That was an accident.
 I'm not that man.
 I'm gonna make this right.
 See, I knew you'd wake up all boo-hooey.
 You probably have half a mind to turn yourself in.
 Luckily, I have the other half.
 - Do you like magic tricks? - What? Of course you like magic tricks.
 After all, I do.
 Well, guess what? I can make a body disappear.
 Where is she? Where is Ms.
 Kringle's body? Open the envelope.
 I hid her body while you were catching some Zs, you'll need a helping hand, so look for her initials down at the GCPD.
 You went to my work last night? Well, technically, you did.
 I was just in the driver's seat, - so to speak.
 - How? You're a figment of my imagination.
 A projection of impulse.
 Nothing more.
 That is uncalled for.
 Uncalled for? You hijacked my body while I was asleep and you stole my dead girlfriend.
 Okay.
 Yeah, that's true.
 But I'm doing this for your own good.
 If I was you which, again, I sort of am I'd get cracking.
 You do want to find the body first, right? Reporting live from city hall, as we celebrate the latest mayoral election.
 Early exit polling confirmed that Gotham City's new mayor will be Theo Galavan, who is projected to win in a landslide, helped by the endorsement of many prominent citizens, including police union president James Gordon, city controller Edwin I can't believe you're gonna be mayor of this sinkhole.
 Can I go to the victory party tonight? You promised me fun.
 When are we gonna unleash a little hell? There'll be plenty of time for unleashing hell and parties once Bruce Wayne has signed over his company and met his unfortunate destiny.
 Until then, I need focus.
 Young Bruce has become fond of you.
 His trust will be crucial when the time comes.
 I need you to ensure that no one else is whispering in his ear until I make my offer.
 See this finger? I've got little Bruce wrapped tight around it.
 What a vixen you've become.
 You make me very proud.
 And we have Penguin to deal with.
 - I'm on it.
 - No.
 I'm about to become mayor.
 I'm gonna have an army at my disposal.
 Time to use it.
 Looks like you backed the right horse.
 - You trust him? - A Gotham politician? About as far as I can throw him.
 But if he gives the GCPD what it needs, he's all right by me.
 You know, Selina said Penguin was behind - the Wayne Enterprise fires.
 - So? First he's going after mayoral candidates, next thing you know, he's burning down buildings.
 Doesn't make any sense.
 Guy is an abacus of crazy.
 Nothing he does surprises me.
 - What the hell happened? - Penguin.
 He tried to kill our next mayor.
 Mr.
 Cobblepot knew that I was poised to win the election today, and he came to me - seeking an alliance.
 - And you refused.
 I politely declined, yes.
 So he stabbed you in the neck? That seems like a pretty extreme reaction, even for Penguin.
 We've been trying to build a case against Penguin since I got here.
 We assume that he's behind the earlier attacks on the other candidates as well.
 And this is the second time he's tried to kill me.
 The man is a menace.
 And one that I fully intend to put behind bars.
 I assume you have something for me? Arrest warrant for Oswald Cobblepot as well as search and seizures on all his properties and known associates.
 Quite a list.
 We'll get right on it.
 Anything else? Yes.
 In light of recent events, Judge Turnball has declared a state of emergency and granted the mayor's office additional powers.
 Meaning what, exactly? The moment I'm sworn in, I'm implementing a curfew and I'm ordering your Strike Force to begin door-to-door searches until Mr.
 Cobblepot is apprehended.
 You're talking about martial law? We're talking about bringing a dangerous fugitive to justice.
 We'll be acting within our legal rights.
 - Am I right, Mr.
 Dent? - Absolutely.
 You'll have our full support, sir.
 Thank you, Captain.
 Detective Gordon? You seem hesitant.
 Cautious.
 You told me we needed to use every method at our disposal to go after men like Penguin.
 Men who don't play by the rules.
 Desperate times call for a strong measure.
 I have no problem going after Penguin with everything we've got, but if we start kicking down the doors of average citizens and policing through fear, we're no better than he is.
 - People still need to trust us.
 - And they will.
 Because at the end of the day, all people want is to feel safe.
 Just remember, Detective.
 You came to me.
 Theo Galavan will be the mayor of Gotham.
 A crowd has gathered outside, and the excitement is brimming, and in just a moment, we'll also be talking to many of the supporters that gave up their time and effort to support What do you have against the front door? Nothing.
 It's the ape who opens it who I could live without.
 I haven't seen you in a month.
 Selina, what are you doing here? You wouldn't believe the week I've had.
 This friend of mine, Bridgit, decided to build this fire suit.
 - Selina - Some people just don't Whose is that? Sorry.
 I got lost on the way back from Hello.
 Hi.
 Silver St.
 Cloud, this is my friend Selina.
 - Selina, this is Silver.
 - Nice to meet you.
 You, too.
 Are you staying for lunch? - No.
 - Please say you are.
 I just moved here and don't know many people.
 Bruce, go tell Alfred to set another place for lunch.
 Come on, it'll be fun! Go.
 Shoo.
 While it's just us girls, let me give you a little advice.
 You come around here again Well, that would be bad.
 For you.
 - Who the hell are you? - I'm Bruce's friend.
 His only friend.
 And you're a piece of gutter trash.
 Now, tell me something, would anyone miss you if one day you were just gone? I didn't think so.
 I told Alfred.
 What are you guys talking about? Nothing.
 Just girl stuff.
 you'll need a helping hand.
 Look for her initials down at the GCPD.
 Look for her initials down at the GCPD? Look for her initials down at the GCPD.
 Kristen Kringle.
 K.
K.
 K.
K.
 K.
K.
, K.
K.
, K.
K.
 No.
 Come on.
 Hey, Mike, can you give me a hand with this? Putting Penguin in the cross-hairs of the GCPD will drive him underground.
 We can't kill him if we can't find him.
 We won't have to find him.
 He's going to deliver himself to us.
 And why would he do that? Penguin's rage will consume his better judgment, leaving him with an insatiable craving for revenge.
 All we need to do is keep him hungry and invite him to dinner.
 And then I get to kill him? Yes, kitten.
 Then you get to kill him.
 First, I would like to thank this city for the immense trust it has placed in me.
 I'm eager to get to work.
 I'd also like to address the recent attempt on my life by the man known as Penguin.
 It is true that he attacked me, and as of now, he is still at large.
 Men such as Penguin will no longer be tolerated.
 These are men who scurry from the light of decency like cockroaches.
 Men who not even a mother could love.
 He dies.
 Tonight.
 Yeah.
 Got it.
 Gilzean's holed up in a booze joint downtown.
 - Penguin? - Hmm-mm.
 And get this.
 Word on the street is Gilzean's started his own crew.
 Sounds like they had a falling out.
 - Maybe he's ready to talk.
 - Yeah.
 Hey.
 I heard about what happened to our new mayor.
 - Never a dull moment, huh? - No kidding.
 You left your keys again this morning.
 Oh.
 Thank you.
 What's this one? A key to my apartment.
 - Oh? - I'll be in the car.
 What? It's just a key.
 Yeah, no, uh Do you want a key to my place? Not even a little bit.
 Wait.
 Do you have a place? I think so.
 Sorry.
 Caught me off guard.
 I guess I do spend most nights there.
 Which I love.
00 a.
m.
 when you come home from a stakeout smelling of chili dogs.
 I love to watch you squirm.
 - I was not squirming.
 - Little squirm.
 I had no idea we were entertaining today, Master Bruce.
 Anyone else popping by? No.
 Thank you, Alfred.
 This is marvelous, Alfred.
 I fell in love with Lapsang souchong when I lived in Fujian.
 Driving through the Wuyi region, all you could smell is the burning cedar they use to smoke leaves.
 Right, well, technically it's, uh, pinewood, miss, but I appreciate the enthusiasm.
 That smell really does slap you in the face, doesn't it, Alfred? So, Selina? Tell me about yourself.
 Any family? You really buying her act? I beg your pardon? Let me ask you a question.
 How long have you been a two-faced slut? - Selina! - No, seriously, what're you after? It's the money, right? I mean it's not his wacky sense of humor.
 - I think I should go.
 - No, wait.
 Is that a tear? You're good.
 I'm sorry.
 Good-bye, Bruce.
 Silver.
 What did you just do?! I know you're not the best judge of, like, you know, people, but that girl is bad news.
 I just did you a favor.
 I want you to leave.
 Fine.
 - Whatever.
 - Maybe you're right.
 Maybe I'm not the best judge of people.
 Because all this time, I thought you were my friend.
 But clearly, you have no idea what that means.
 I'm tired of hiding and want to be free.
 To locate her body, find the two things missing from me.
 The back of our head kind of looks funny.
 It's like the top of a pencil.
 Why are you doing this? Because it's fun! And it's good for you.
 How is it good for me to be tortured? To be driven insane! I'm trying to show you who you are.
 How have you not realized that yet? Though, to be honest, I'm surprised you haven't figured out this riddle yet.
 Should I have made it easier? You could start by using proper grammar.
 A period at the end of a sentence is Find the two things missing from ME M, period, E, period.
 Oh, God.
 M.
E medical examiner.
 You didn't! I did.
 I say we wait and see if someone can walk us inside.
 Try and keep things civil.
 Did I tell you I was thinking about getting a cat? What? Hey! How are you? Why don't you get your head in the game here? I'm sorry.
 It's just Do you believe Galavan's story? Questions like that are above my pay grade and below my sense of wonder.
 Penguin's a pragmatist.
 Hitting Galavan for refusing an alliance? That doesn't get him anything but heat.
 So, what really happened do you think? A few months ago, nobody knew who Galavan was, right? Now, all of a sudden, he's mayor? Doesn't happen by accident.
 It takes planning.
 And it takes help.
 Guys like Galavan are born on third base.
 Stealing home's practically a birthright.
 Think about the timing.
 He shows up just after Mayor James disappears.
 The massacre at the gala turns him into a hero.
 Penguin's assassination attempts on mayoral candidates launched his campaign.
 Everything that's gone down up to this point, you could argue was orchestrated.
 Look, what you're talking about is Machiavellian-level crazy, even by Gotham standards.
 Yeah.
 There's our door pass.
 Yeah, so your mother tells you.
 Yeah, his mama stopped talking to me ages ago.
 Oh, finally.
 Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! I wouldn't! Aw, come on.
 I really wouldn't.
 That's a lot of firepower there, Butch.
 You expecting company? Neighborhood ain't what it used to be, Jim.
 Where's Penguin? How should I know? You're the boss' lapdog and you don't know where your owner is? I ain't nobody's lapdog.
 Not anymore.
 Prove it.
 Tell us why the hell Penguin went after Galavan.
 I ain't telling you anything.
 And unless you have a warrant, I'm gonna have to ask you boys to leave.
 Yeah, see the thing is our newly elected mayor kind of wants results on this.
 So we drag you in, chances are that's where you're gonna stay.
 I'm here for Gilzean! Anyone who leaves now leaves alive.
 Anyone who stays dies! You have 60 seconds to do the math.
 Sorry, Butch.
 Seriously? No honor among scumbags, huh? Hey, don't shoot! I'm out of here! What are you doing? You tell us what the hell's going on with Penguin or we leave you with Zsasz.
 You can't do that.
 Bullock? We can totally do that.
 Galavan was telling Penguin what to do.
 Knocking off the candidates, torching the buildings It all came down from Galavan.
 The hell was Penguin taking orders? Kidnapped Penguin's mother.
 - He was keeping her for leverage.
 - Kidnapped? Jim? I think we need to go.
 I didn't think Galavan actually go through with it.
 Go through with what? Go through with what?! GCPD! Put down your weapons! We're out-manned here big time, partner.
 Yeah.
 But not out-gunned.
 Oh, hell yeah.
 I'll take that as a no! See you later, Butch! That's a new one.
 You think he was telling the truth? Nobody's telling the truth.
 This is Gotham.
 Bruce.
 What a lovely surprise.
 Hello, sir.
 I was looking for Silver.
 She's here.
 Seemed a bit upset when she came in.
 Yes, a friend of mine stopped by the house when Silver was there.
 - They - Say no more.
 I was your age once.
 Your feelings do you credit.
 I never met your father, but it's clear that he instilled in you a sound moral compass.
 He did.
 You know, we're both very alike.
 Born into wealth and privilege, yet forced to walk our lives alone.
 Haunted by loss.
 Driven to prove ourselves worthy to those who came before.
 Be careful, Bruce.
 That way of thinking The need to fill a void It can consume you.
 - Does it ever go away? - No.
 But you can find closure; a way to move on without letting go.
 How? Well I don't want to make any promises, but when the time is right, we'll talk again.
 I, uh, need to get ready for the party.
 Excuse me.
 I knew you'd come.
 No one's to kill Galavan but me.
 Understand? Boss, I get what you're feeling.
 Mother's love It's the most beautiful, - most simple - Gabe! Cops aren't gonna let you within a hundred feet of Galavan.
 Let us whack him for you, please? No.
 He's mine.
 Now, let's get dressed.
 We've got a party to attend.
 Listen up, people! Our newly elected mayor is going ahead with his victory celebration tonight.
 He will be exposed.
 He will be vulnerable.
 And he will be protected.
 By you.
 The brave men and women of this police force.
 You all have your assignments.
 Detective Gordon here will be running point.
 Detective? Penguin has already made one attempt on Galavan's life today.
 We should be ready for anything.
 Let's show this city what it means to carry a badge.
 As you were.
 I want check-ins from perimeter teams every five minutes.
 Martinez, how's the avenue looking? All clear.
 Sniper Teams Alpha and Bravo report all clear as well.
 Copy that.
 What you find out? Spoke to the super at Gertrude Cobblepot's building.
 Turns out, no one's seen her for two weeks.
 Timeline matches Gilzean's story.
 Maybe or maybe the old broad's on a sunset cruise, hmm? You know, there's something that Gilzean said that I can't shake.
 He said he never thought Galavan would go through with it.
 Go through with what? I don't think Gertrude Cobblepot is on a cruise.
 Ladies and gentlemen, let me be the first to officially introduce you to the honorable Theo Galavan, the new mayor of Gotham! Ed? Oh What are you doing? Dr.
 Thompkins, hello.
 Uh, I'm just double-checking notes for a Jane Doe case I'm working.
 Do you need help? No! No, no, no.
 She's all gone.
 Or she's I'm sorry, I'm I'm all done with checking my notes.
 Uh, what notes? It's all up here.
 Do you realize that by assigning simple mnemonic devices to case files, you can produce recall capacity equal to that of photographic or even eidetic memory? - Ed, what's going on? - Okay.
 Um, truth be told, uh I was hoping to run into you here.
 Alone.
 It's Miss Kringle.
 Uh We had a fight.
 I'm sorry.
 Every relationship hits a rough patch now and then.
 And you've been so supportive.
 And I was hoping that maybe we-we could go grab a coffee and you could give me some advice.
 Uh, do you want to finish up what you were doing first? No, no, no, no.
 I I can come back another time.
 It's not like they're gonna go anywhere, right? You'd think so.
 Yeah, okay.
 Detective Gordon.
 Hey.
 That's it, sir.
 Perfect.
 Thank you so much.
 I, uh, heard about your shoot-out today.
 Something about one of Penguin's former Lieutenants, a Butch Gilzean? Some men ambushed us as we were questioning him.
 He escaped.
 Did you get anything out of him? Before the attack? No.
 That's a pity.
 Well Detective, I have a large group of men approaching from off the main road.
 I have eyes on the target.
 Appears to be Cobblepot, sir.
 Hold your fire.
 Perimeter units, prepare to engage.
 The target is down.
 - Martinez, I said hold your fire.
 - It wasn't us.
 We have an unknown shooter on the roof.
 we have an unknown shooter on the roof.
 Martinez.
 Is Penguin dead? - No, it wasn't him.
 - Find the other shooter and find Penguin We need him alive.
 Detective, all the targets are dressed as Penguin, and all are heavily armed.
 Positive I.
D.
 is impossible.
 Martinez, you're clear to engage.
 All perimeter units, crash our location now.
 Drop it.
 Turn around.
 Hands above your head, now.
 So forceful.
 I like a strong confident man.
 We got to get you out of here.
 Radio his driver, have him pull the car around to the back service entrance.
 - Got it? - Yes.
 - Cover us? - No problem.
 Remaining officers stay inside and clear the lobby.
 Confirmed.
 Primary is on the move.
 Initiating exit plan using the south entrance.
 Roger that, Detective Gordon is en route to the rear entrance with the mayor.
 Need that limo at the back service entrance, stat.
 Copy that.
 Get him out of here! Go! Hello, Jim.
 Please step aside.
 You know I can't do that.
 You would if you knew what kind of man you were protecting.
 Shoot him, Detective.
 Oswald, listen to me.
 You have to put the gun down.
 He killed my mother, Jim.
 I know.
 Detective Gordon, I am ordering you to put that man down now.
 He had her murdered in front of me.
 I held her.
 Watched her die.
 Do you know what that's like? It changes a person.
 Sorry about your mother, Penguin, but I'm gonna need you to put the shotgun down on the ground, slowly, now.
 One of us is gonna die tonight.
 I have made my peace with that.
 I suggest the new mayor does as well.
 Don't make us shoot you.
 Shoot me and you have no idea what his endgame is, Jim.
 And you should.
 Because it concerns someone you know, someone you care about.
 Shoot him.
 Down! Jim, Oswald! Penguin smashed the mayor's ride through the main checkpoint.
 The good news is With the gunshot wound to the shoulder and the APB, I doubt he'll make it out of the city.
 He won't be trying to make it out.
 We lost more people tonight.
 Good people, including Martinez.
 Sometimes the good guys have a bad night.
 - This ain't your fault.
 - I know.
 It's his.
 My ancestors were swordsmiths.
 They knew that to make good steel, it had first to be forged.
 I look at tonight I look at tonight as a baptism of fire.
 A fire from which we will emerge stronger.
 Our resolve forged to bring about a new day in Gotham.
 I've felt pretty alone since moving here.
 Until I met you.
 But I-I don't want to come between you and a friend.
 You won't.
 Selina is never going to like me.
 I don't care.
 I like you.
 - Detective Gordon.
 - Mr.
 Mayor.
 You catch my speech? I think I've heard enough speeches.
 I had high hopes for you.
 I thought you were prepared to make the hard choices, to do whatever it takes to rid Gotham of its monsters.
 I am.
 I've just decided I'm gonna start with you.
 Dangerous words when addressing the man who now controls this city.
 Desperate times.
 They are, indeed.
 I want to know why you did this.
 When Dr.
 Thompkins walked in the room, how did it feel? I was terrified.
 She could have discovered the body.
 But she didn't.
 You got away with it.
 That's not the point.
 That is absolutely the point! You can still feel the rush, can't you? Coming so close to getting caught.
 Knowing what you would have been forced to do if she had discovered the body, discovered what you had done.
 Standing standing at the edge of uncertainty and peering into the void.
 Now tell me, how did it feel? Beautiful.
   

                



                


                    			Previously on Gotham Cops aren't gonna let you within 100 feet of Galavan.
 - Let us whack him for you.
 - No.
 He's mine.
 - Shoot him, Detective.
 - He killed my mother, Jim.
 - You have the Wayne boy.
 Not yet.
 There are some practical matters that have to be resolved first.
 See this finger? I've got little Bruce wrapped tight around it.
 I had to kill him.
 'Cause he hit you.
 I love you.
 No! Within a year, Jim and I will be back together.
  Want to know why? Because we're both the same.
 We both have a dark side.
  Ready for the practice run? I'm ready to skip this and get married.
 Me, too.
 Let us rehearse the vows.
 - Barbara Kean - Mmm.
 Do you take James Gordon to be your unlawfully wedded husband - to have and to hold - I'm sorry, Father.
 You said unlawfully wedded.
 Barbara, just answer him, for God'sake.
  I'm waiting.
 Barbara, what's wrong?   How did you do that?      Bad dream.
 _  Doesn't being mayor mean you can sleep in? Jim Gordon has forced us to accelerate our plans.
 About time.
 I'll meet with Bruce Wayne this morning.
 If all goes well, I'll have his company by the end of the day.
 I still don't see how you can get Bruce Wayne to turn over his family's legacy.
 You're not that charming.
 I'm going to offer him the thing he wants most in the world.
 Still, it will be delicate.
 Jim Gordon must not be allowed to interfere.
 But his sudden death would upset Bruce.
 I love my present.
 Does it mean what I think it does? Yes, my dear.
 Today is the day you get to kill Jim Gordon.
 The breakout at Arkham, the massacre of the GCPD, the gala, the arsons, it was Galavan.
 He's behind everything.
 And you have proof of this? I have Penguin, and I have Gilzean.
 Both criminals.
 Both in the wind.
 Given the circumstances under which I obtained the information, I think it's safe to say they were telling the truth.
 Maybe they are.
 But you have no legal evidence, no proof, not a single hard lead to go on.
 You bring in Galavan with what you have now, - and he'll just laugh at you.
 - He won't laugh long.
 Are you gonna rough him up a little? Lawless thuggery, is that your plan? You want to arrest Galavan? You do the police work and you bring me back some real proof.
 Can you blame him? You're going after a man who was elected mayor yesterday.
 The most popular figure in Gotham.
 Galavan is dirty.
 I'd bet my life on it.
 - Well, don't.
 - Don't what? Don't bet your life on it.
 I know that look in your eye, Jim.
 Be cool.
 Do not make this personal.
 Well, it is personal, isn't it? Only if you make it that way.
 Suspect! Suspect! Put your hands where I can see them! Right there! Hi, Jim.
 Long time no see.
 They said you'd only talk to me.
 I'm listening.
 Yes.
 Here it is.
 Is there any chance I could get a latte - or something? - This is not a game, Barbara.
 Oh.
 Of course it is.
 It's a game you've been losing.
 Big-time.
 It is not a game.
  It must be killing you.
 All that righteous indignation with no place to go.
 Why are you here? Don't act all calm and businesslike.
 Rough me up a little, if you want.
 I don't want to do that.
 I don't want to hurt you.
 I want to help you.
 I know you want to hurt me, just a little.
 I've been a very bad girl.
 No.
 You're a good woman.
 You're just sick, is all.
  Oh.
  I knew it.
 I knew you still had feelings for me.
 Of course I have feelings.
  Talk to me.
 I will.
 But first I want to show you something.
 It's not far away, won't take long.
 Well, what is it? What do you want to show me? It's a surprise.
 Don't worry, it's a good one.
 And then after that, I will tell you everything.
 Detective Gordon?  Okay, that's someone telling you that my lawyer is here.
 Why don't you take five minutes to think about it?  Detective Gordon, time's up.
 Not sure, sir.
 I suggest we play along and find out.
 I'll go see this thing she wants to show me.
 Jim, she's mentally ill.
 Like hell.
 She's sharp as a nail.
 This is a trap.
 Yeah.
 Either way, it's too risky.
 What choice do we have, huh? She won't talk.
 And kissing her didn't work out, did it? That was a judgment call, sir.
 Judgment? Really? Let's focus on the issue at hand.
 It's my official opinion as chief medical examiner that Miss Kean is seriously mentally ill and should be in a hospital, getting treatment.
 Yes.
 Tomorrow.
 Look, I suggest we play along, let her think she's in control.
 I can still work on her inside the car.
 Maybe I can find out something useful.
 She's our only link to Galavan.
 It's worth the risk.
 All right, do it.
     Oh, sorry, Miss Kringle.
  You have a visitor, Miss St.
 Cloud.
 Hi.
 Hello.
 My uncle will be just a moment.
 He wanted me to apologize for keeping you waiting.
  It's fine.
 Do you have any idea why he wanted to see me? He told me he had something for you.
 He seemed excited.
 It was totally goofy.
 I can't picture him goofy.
 I am so sorry to keep you waiting.
 I'll see you later.
 Bye.
 Please.
 Meet the new crop of Strike Force members.
 We're throwing them in the deep end, but they're ready.
 They'll be shadowing you in a TAC SUV.
 I'll be monitoring from here.
 Yes, sir.
 Gordon? Agreed.
 He's too wrapped up in this thing emotionally.
 I need to know that one of you isn't gonna get sucked into all these mind games that Ms.
 Kean is gonna be pulling out there.
 Not to worry no one's ever accused me of getting sucked into mind games.
 Just follow my orders, understood? Understood, Captain.
 I'm glad we had this chance to talk.
 Hey, look.
 I don't like this any more than you do.
 But it is the only way.
 No, this is you, Jim.
 This is all you.
 She sucked you right back in, didn't she? Because she still has a hold on you.
 Her sickness and yours feed off each other.
 What do you mean, my sickness? I'm not sick.
 You see an abyss, and you run toward it.
 That's not healthy.
 I'm just doing my job.
 Moving out! Hey, Lee.
 You don't mind if I borrow him for a little while, do you?  I want to ask you a question.
 If you could have one dream come true, what would that be? I would find the man who killed my parents.
 What would you do if you found him? I would kill him.
 What a young tiger you are.
 My dream? I would save this city.
 I would rid Gotham of corruption, crime and poverty.
 Sounds good.
 How would you do that? Oh, I have plans, schemes, ideas aplenty.
 But I need help.
 I need your help.
 Of course.
 And perhaps in return, I could help you with your dream.
 Get those vehicles out of the way! You good? Anything that makes Captain Barnes' tight ass nervous, I'm all for.
 Watch your head.
 So, you want to tell us where we're going? Head downtown.
  Bruce, your family helped build this city.
 The Wayne name is synonymous with growth, strength and prosperity.
 It's also a lie.
 Please explain what you mean.
 I've been investigating Wayne Enterprises for quite some time.
 You know what I found? Toxic waste dumps.
 Illegal weapons contracts.
 Use of banned chemicals.
 Nightmarish experiments.
 It can't continue.
 Please, understand this isn't about corruption.
 It's about saving innocent lives.
 You have my word.
 I will look into all of it.
 And I will stop whoever's responsible.
 No, Bruce, you won't.
 You can't.
 People often underestimate me.
 Wayne Enterprises is a multi-billion-dollar conglomerate, with a board that will kill to protect its secrets.
 Who's underestimating who? Why are you telling me this? You obviously have a solution you want to propose.
  You control 51% of the voting shares of Wayne Enterprises.
 If you sell me your shares, I could take control, do what needs to be done.
 You would be a cash billionaire with freedom.
 You want my company? I want to clean up Gotham.
 Protect its citizens.
 Return the city to what it was.
 But I can't do it without your help.
 Wayne Enterprises is my responsibility.
 It's all I have left of them.
 I'm not just offering you money, Bruce.
 The night your parents were killed, you weren't supposed to be there, were you? No.
 Your parents were headed for the theater.
 Your father changed his mind.
 Suggested a movie.
 Invited you along.
 You got there late.
 Uh I've never told anybody that.
 He was following your father that night.
 Before the alleyway.
 I'm a man of considerable resources.
 Even then, it took some doing.
 It's why I didn't want to say anything last night.
 I couldn't confirm it until today.
 If you sell me your company, I will give you this as a signing gift.
 This is the name of the man who killed your parents with documentary proof accomplices, motives, why, how and who.
 I will fix your company, protect your legacy and give you closure.
 It's what your father would've wanted.
 And what Gotham desperately needs.
 I need your answer by the end of the day.
 Hey, Jim? Cheer up.
 Where's your spirit of adventure? Next right.
  I know it's a trap.
 And Galavan's using you like a puppet.
 It is Galavan who's behind all this, right? Mm-mm-mm He's a psychopath, Barbara.
 He's using you.
 He's laughing at you.
 And when he's done with you, you're just a loose end.
 He'll kill you.
 You really don't like this Galavan guy, do you? She's not talking, Jim.
 We need to turn this car around now.
 Just give me a little more time.
    Well, I'm afraid this is as proper a burial as circumstances allow.
 But I thought we could have one last meal together.
 I was a broken man, Miss Kringle.
 Two halves at war with each other.
 But thanks to you, I am whole.
 I will not forget you.
 I take you by night, by day take you back.
 None suffer to have me, but do from my lack.
 What am I? That some sort of riddle? You know, you really shouldn't sneak up on people; that's not polite.
 Not usually any people out here.
 Can I interest you - in a tea sandwich? - A what? What heck is in there? Aah!  Great.
 Now I've got to improvise.
 Don't go anywhere.
 Barbara, listen to me.
 Are you listening? You have a lifetime ahead of you.
 Don't throw it away on madness.
 Gordon, Bullock come in.
 Go ahead, Captain.
 I don't like this.
 You're boxed in.
 There's lots of cover, high vantage points all around.
 Perfect spot for an ambush.
 Yeah, I gotta pull you out.
 Turn around, you get nothing.
 Not yet.
 You hear me? I'm pulling you out.
 What was that, Captain? You're breaking up.
 Bullock! I swear to God, if you disobey  Barbara, think hard.
 Don't throw away your life.
 What life? You and me we had a life.
 We had real love.
 You asked me to marry you.
 I booked a church.
 I bought a damn wedding dress.
 Jim fool that I am, I still love you, even now.
 And I know you still have feelings for me, 'cause you said so.
 We can talk about our feelings later.
 There's more at stake here.
 I love you, Jim.
 And I think, deep down, you still love me.
 You gonna shoot me, Jim?  I want a 20-block perimeter, with hard target searches of every building, business and bodega.
 We kick down everything with four walls and a roof.
 Nobody sleeps until our boy gets home.
 Hey! I told you to get out of here.
 You did? Still a lot of ringing in my head.
 I must've missed it.
 This is a direct order.
 You don't belong here anymore.
 Go home.
   Okay.
 Well, let's see.
 If I can't make the hole bigger, then I'll make you smaller.
  Who has eaten my sandwich? For a secluded forest, this place sure has a lot of foot traffic.
  Looks like it's gonna get a tad crowded in there.
 I'll be back.
 Ah, there you are, Master Bruce.
 Been looking all over the gaff for you.
 Bit dreary down here, isn't it? Fancy something to eat? What's up? I need to ask you a question.
 And I need your word that you're going to be honest with me.
 I always am.
 All right, you have my word.
 My training the skills that I need to take down the corruption at Wayne Enterprises.
 How long will it take? Well, there's no set timeline.
 It doesn't really work like that, does it? Alfred.
 A year? Two years? Five? Well, a lot longer than that, for you to be the man that you need to be.
 But you will get there, I promise you that.
 Yeah, well, how many will suffer in the meantime? How many will die because of the crimes committed by my family's company? What Who Where's all this coming from, Master Bruce? Eh?  I spoke to Mayor Galavan this morning.
 And? He wants me to sell him my shares in Wayne Enterprises so he can fix the company.
 Clean up Gotham.
 I see.
 And what aren't you telling me? He says that he knows the identity of the man who killed my parents.
 Which he's offering in return for the company, right? Yes.
 Yeah, well, that's not an offer, is it? That's bloody extortion.
 Yeah, well, I can't help but consider it, Alfred.
 Well, you shouldn't.
 There's a fine line between extortion and negotiation.
 Yes, there is, Master Bruce, but there's still a line.
 My parents were killed because of the corruption that my father was trying to stop.
 As of now, their their deaths have been in vain, but if Mayor Galavan can truly if he can truly fix Wayne Enterprises, isn't it my moral duty to allow him to do so? For my father's legacy? Wayne Enterprises isn't Thomas and Martha Wayne's legacy.
 That legacy is standing right here.
 With me.
 I just want I just want it to be over.
 No, no.
 No, you're not wrong.
 Come here.
 You're not wrong.
     I know.
 Can you believe it still fits? Do you remember when we first visited this place? How excited I was to get married here? How long do you think you have before the GCPD finds us? So typical.
 I'm talking about us, and your head  is in work.
 There is no us.
 What is all this? Well, this is my wedding dress.
 The tailor still had it in storage.
 I mean, can you believe the luck? Or fate.
 - That's Father Callahan.
 -  You remember him, of course.
 And these bozos  Oh! Who knows? But you can't have a wedding without witnesses.
 That's the law.
 Barbara Jim Please don't act all surprised and aggrieved.
 You knew, from the start, that this was a trap.
 But you thought, Hey, let the bad guys take their best shot.
 I'm Jim Gordon.
 I'll find a way to win.
  Or die.
 It's option B, baby.
 Your fondest wish come true.
 I don't want to die.
 Oh.
 Hey.
 Sure you do.
 Aren't you tired of hiding your true self? Tired of lying to yourself? To Lee? I don't lie to Lee.
 Really? Let's ask her.
  Lee!  Savor every moment.
 Hey, girlfriend.
 We really need to talk about this bad boy.
 We had real love.
 You asked me to marry you.
 I booked the church.
 I bought a damn wedding dress.
 Jim Fool that I am, I still love you even now.
 I booked the church.
 I bought a damn wedding dress.
 I want updates every 15 minutes.
 Hang on.
 Turn around and get the hell out of here.
 - She's taking him to church.
 - Church? What church? She talked about the wedding they never had.
 She wants a do-over.
 Gotham Cathedral is nearest to the snatch site.
 That's where they are.
 That's thin.
 I know I am right.
 I'll call you back.
 Let's go.
  So, Lee, how do you think your relationship with Jim is going? This doesn't concern Lee.
 Let her go.
 This is between you and me.
 Oh.
 This is about all of us.
 She deserves to know exactly who you are.
 I know who he is.
 Oh, how could you when he doesn't even know? He is incapable of being honest with himself, let alone anyone else.
 What about you? This entire day has been a lie.
 You were never going to give up proof on Galavan.
 Who? Oh.
 You want some honesty? Fine.
 Mayor James is alive and well at a stash house on China Docks.
 Hmm, see? Honesty.
 Now you.
 Who put him there? Who put him there? Boring, Jim.
 The Jim Gordon you know is an act.
 He's like an addict who thinks he can dabble in darkness as long as nobody sees the needle marks.
 - Everyone has an act.
 -  Did he tell you how he got reinstated at the GCPD? He killed a man for Penguin.
 Wow! Very good, Jim.
 You did tell her.
 We don't have secrets between us.
 Mm-hmm.
 He's done a lot of things that he's not proud of.
 - Everyone has.
 - Oh.
 But you love him anyway, is that right? Despite all his faults.
 Yes, I do.
 Cute little do-gooder Dr.
 Lee, hmm in love with a cruel, cold, death-obsessed sadist.
 -  - That's not Jim.
 Do you think you know him better than I do? Hmm? I love him, too, you know.
 I know him better than you do.
 Okay, Barbara, I hear you.
 You love him.
 We both love him.
 - That's okay.
 - But I love him more.
 Okay, listen, Barbara.
 I know that now.
 Please I'm gonna prove that I love him more.
 I am going to carve your pretty face off your skull.
 And then you will both understand what true love is.
 - Okay, just one more thing.
 - What? Your dress.
 I-I love your dress.
 I just want to know where you got it.
 Hmm.
 Oh, um Drop the knife.
 There he is.
 My little monster.
 - Don't make me kill you.
 - Make you? Jim, you long to kill me.
 Do it, Jim.
 Do me.
  Don't take another step.
  Kill him!  Go get her! Jim! It's over.
 Not yet.
  Hold on.
 Hold on.
 I'm sorry, baby.
 I've been kind of a bad date, huh? I love you, baby.
 No! Some hedges and bushes broke her fall, but she's got half a dozen broken bones and a concussion.
 She's critical.
 - Are you okay? - Yeah.
   Not now, but when this is over, we need to talk.
 I know.
 Tell me you got something from her.
 She didn't give up Galavan, but she did say Mayor James is alive.
 Stashed in a safe house on China Docks.
 Ten-four, Captain.
 Help.
 What is wrong with these people? Help me.
 Mayor James? Help me, please.
 Oh, thank God.
 All the papers seem to be in order.
 You are making the right decision.
 Sign and the file is yours.
 I I changed my mind.
 I can't sell you my company.
 Not for any price.
 Alfred, get Bruce away from him now.
 Detective Gordon? You're under arrest.
 Surprised to see me?  May I ask what the charge is? The kidnapping and torture of Aubrey James.
 - Cuff him.
 Get him out of here.
 Where? No! No! Tell me who killed them! Please.
 I'll do anything.
 Finally.
  Oh!  Oh, my.
  Mr.
 Penguin? Help me, please.
   

                



                


                    			 - Previously on Gotham - Father Creel.
 - You have the Wayne boy? - Not yet.
 There are some practical matters that have to be resolved first.
 Whoa! - Mr.
 Penguin? - Help me.
 This is the name of the man who killed your parents.
 Sell me your company.
 I will give you this as a signing gift.
 I've been a very bad girl.
 You're a good woman.
 You're just sick.
 I knew you still had feelings for me.
 I want to show you something.
 You're under arrest! May I ask what the charge is? The kidnapping and torture of Aubrey James.
 No! Tell me who killed them! Can you believe it still fits? Don't make me kill you.
 Do it, Jim.
 Do me.
 Kill him! It's over.
 Not yet.
 - Hold on.
 - I love you, baby.
 No! Here you go! Morning.
 Help you? I was told to order a Highsmith Royale.
 Bit early, don't you think? I said Highsmith Royale.
 No ice.
 There you go, man.
 How may I help you? I need somebody killed and I heard that you employ the best.
 Oh, yes, I know you.
 Our illustrious mayor's sister.
 Or should I say ex-mayor? Word is, you're quite the deadeye yourself.
 Why come to us? - Had an accident.
 My aim is off.
 - Hmm.
 Is this business, personal? What's it matter to you? Personal costs extra.
 There's always complications.
 It's business.
 - A cop.
 - Seems personal to me.
 Anyhow, cops also cost extra.
 Fine.
 I want it done today.
 What kind of guarantee do I get? I accept the job, the job gets done.
 Period.
 You see, I believe in the beauty of extreme measures.
 So who's the lucky fellow? Ms.
 Kean has yet to regain consciousness.
 With this kind of trauma, we have no idea when she might wake up.
 If ever.
 But the medical wing at Arkham is fully equipped to handle her condition.
 Will you be riding over with her? No.
 Hello, sleepyhead.
 Where am I? Rapid movement and elevated heart rate are counterproductive to the healing process.
 - No! No! Don't kill me! - Apologies in advance.
 Rest up, my feathered friend.
 We have a big night ahead of us.
 Looking for this? Thank you.
 You left before I woke up.
 I know.
 Couldn't sleep.
 - Was I snoring? - No.
 Are you sure? My big, loud, rumbling, barnyard snore? I've heard complaints neighbors, - airplanes - You don't snore.
 Look, I'm glad Galavan's been arrested, but he should pay for everything he's done.
 I'm on my way to meet Barnes at Galavan's penthouse.
 Hopefully, we can find some evidence to corroborate Aubrey James' testimony.
 I got a call.
 They're transferring Barbara to Arkham.
 I know.
 I stopped by Gotham General.
 You went to see her? She's a witness against Galavan.
 I wanted to check on her condition.
 Her condition is she's in a coma.
 We never talked about what happened with you and Barbara in that interrogation room.
 I know.
 Tonight? Sure, tonight.
 Or right now.
 Lee, I went over to see her as a part of the case against Galavan, that is it.
 This isn't jealousy.
 That woman is How do I put this? She's the devil.
 No, she is.
 She's the devil.
 Lee you think I wanted things to go the way they did? - I had to play her game.
 - I know.
 Uh, forget about Barbara.
 Most people fight their dark side.
 Lately, you find ways to give in to it.
 That's a problem.
 - For you and for us.
 - I know.
 I hear you.
 Can we please just not talk about this right now? I'm late to meet Barnes.
 I'll be fine.
 I wasn't sure you'd ever want to see me again.
 When you called You don't believe what they're saying about my uncle do you? No.
 Of course not.
 Silver, I asked you here because I need your help.
 Anything.
 Before he was arrested, your uncle made me an offer.
 - I want - Right, Master Bruce! On your feet.
 Bought us a lovely couple of rakes from the ironmonger's.
 I suggest we get outside and get Hello, Ms.
 St.
 Cloud.
 Did not expect to see you here.
 - Hello, Alfred.
 - That must have been your car I saw, idling on the main road.
 Now, in light of recent events, I suggest you get in it and you leave.
 Immediately.
 I invited her, and I want her to stay.
 And I'm ordering her to leave.
 And it's my house, and I give the orders.
 Oh, is that so? It's okay.
 I don't want to cause any trouble.
 Smart girl.
 Off you pop.
 I'm at the Kane Hotel.
 - You had no right to do that.
 - I had every right.
 What were you thinking, asking her up here? Oh, wait, you think she was gonna tell you something.
 If Galavan really has the name of my parents' killer in that envelope, it's worth a shot.
 Well, my guess is there was absolutely nothing in that envelope.
 It was just a ruse to get you to sign away the company.
 Galavan is smart.
 He wouldn't enter a multibillion-dollar offer without his end of the bargain.
 He has the name.
 And you think that little minx is gonna tell you something, do you? - We're friends.
 - No, you're not.
 Getting information out of a girl like that requires a level of deception that you do not yet possess, Master Bruce.
 - It is too dangerous.
 - It's worth the risk.
 No.
 You will not see Ms.
 St.
 Cloud again or pursue Galavan's wild claims.
 You have no right to make that decision for me.
 Well, someone has to.
 If you force me to be your jailer then that is who I will be.
 Excuse me.
 Thank you.
 Press 56, please? You live here? No.
 Me neither.
 Lady's baby grand is flat, so I don't mind making house calls.
 I like my work.
 You like your work? Yeah.
 I do.
 I guess we're lucky.
 Caramel? No, I'm good.
 You're missing out; they're good.
 Where the hell is Gordon? - Who is that? - No idea.
 But he just tried to kill me.
 - He tell you why? - Wasn't random.
 Piano wire.
 Guy's a pro.
 No, wait, wait.
 You feeling lucky, Ned? You got this! Listen up.
 Who wants a shot at eighty-sixing one of Gotham's finest? I'm waiving any collateral fines.
 Just do what you have to do, but Jim Gordon doesn't see the sun rise.
 You drugged me.
 That was for your own benefit, Mr.
 Penguin.
 You have extensive injuries.
 I know you.
 Ed.
 Nygma.
 We met once before, at the GCPD.
 - You're not a cop.
 - Oh, no, no, no.
 No, I'm in forensics.
 Do you believe in fate? Where are my clothes? Oh, I threw them away.
 They smelled.
 Oh, no.
 Oh, my.
 Uh, I'm afraid, sir, that you can't leave.
 You sedate me again, and I swear, I will Sir! You are a wanted man.
 You can try and run, but with your condition, you'll get about three blocks.
 I'm afraid that you're stuck here until you recover.
 Now, drink up.
 It's just water.
 Dehydration is common after prolonged outdoor exposure.
 What do you want from me? Remember I had mentioned fate? Recently, I've been going through a sort of change.
 What kind of change? you ask.
 - I didn't.
 - I've started murdering people.
 Wow! That is thrilling to say out loud.
 How many people? Three in total.
 Two of them I didn't really care for.
 But one was my girlfriend, Ms.
 Kringle.
 She was the love of my life.
 If you're planning on killing me, could you get on with it? At this point, it would come as a welcome relief.
 Oh, heavens.
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 I have no ill intentions toward you.
 Then what are your intentions? I need advice, Mr.
 Penguin.
 These murders changed me.
 And like the butterfly, I've come to realize that I cannot be a caterpillar once again.
 And you're one of the city's most notorious killers.
 I brought you here, in part, because I was hoping you could guide me on this new path.
 - Listen, friend - Ed.
 Whatever.
 My empire is in ruins.
 I'm a wanted man with no friends.
 And my mother the one person I swore to protect is dead because of my weakness.
 Believe me when I tell you that this path you're on leads to nothing but destruction and pain.
 So wanted or not I'm leaving.
 Oh, my.
 Rise and shine.
 Hell with this.
 Who sent you? Huh? Who sent you?! Your mother.
 That's what I was hoping you would say.
 No! Don't! Talk! Detective Gordon, stand down! Stand down right now! Parks, watch the perp.
 Cortez, you shut the window.
 Come over here! You know damn well I don't tolerate that type of behavior, and yet you pull that crap right in front of me? I'm sorry, sir.
 Are you losing it, Gordon? Has that church incident messed with your mind? No, sir.
 'Cause if I remember correctly, you disobeying my orders is what landed you there in the first place.
 I ordered you to turn that car around, and you ignored me and drove straight into an ambush.
 And ended the day putting Galavan behind bars.
 We need to push the boundaries.
 Captain! My employer has a strict protocol.
 If the first guy doesn't succeed, keep sending men till the job is done.
 None of you is making it out of here alive.
 When you get here, move carefully.
 We don't know how many active skells we're dealing with.
 All right.
 Two units on the way here.
 We just have to hold out till they get here.
 Hey, Cortez, kill the lights.
 Sir, I'm forensics.
 I don't have a gun.
 Grab something you can use as a weapon, and stay behind us as best you can, all right? Parks, take cover behind the desk.
 Hey.
 Remember your training.
 - Aim for center mass.
 - Right.
 Center mass.
 And don't stop firing until you're sure.
 - And, Parks - Yes, sir? Breathe.
 Help me! Drop the knife! I'm leaving.
 - Not gonna happen.
 - Try to stop me.
 I'll lop off her pretty little head.
 You know what I like about those glasses? They look like bull's-eyes.
 - Are you okay? - I am.
 Okay! We're not gonna hang around for round two.
 Everybody load up, and let's get the hell out of here.
 I'm not leaving.
 That wasn't a request.
 This place is still our best bet for evidence against Galavan.
 We leave, they'll destroy it.
 Now you're just looking for a fight.
 Parks, make sure the staircase is clear.
 I've got a civilian who's dead and a rookie who's scared half out of her mind.
 You think we're gonna survive the next attack with just a few handguns? We have to get out of here.
 Wait.
 A monk's cassock? What the hell is this about? I don't know, but we have to get out of here.
 - Let's go! - Captain Captain! This could be exactly what we're looking for.
 Knife! Captain! Captain! You okay? It's just a scratch.
 - Let's get out of here.
 - No, no.
 The knife punctured an artery.
 You move, it could tear.
 What are you, a doctor now? I can move.
 You stand up, you'll bleed out in a matter of minutes.
 Ta-da! Who is that? This is Mr.
 Leonard.
 You were talking in your sleep last night about Galavan killing your mother.
 - I was? - Yes.
 Mr.
 Leonard works for Galavan.
 Well, before he was arrested, of course.
 Arrested? Detective Gordon arrested Galavan for kidnapping Mayor James.
 He's in Blackgate! Huh.
 Oh, I thought you'd be pleased.
 It doesn't matter anymore.
 - Why is he here? - He was a gift for you.
 And what exactly am I supposed to do with a Leonard? Kill him.
 I thought it might be nice to get some retribution for your mother's death.
 That it might cheer you up a little.
 No? I'm done.
 I need some rest.
 And then I'm leaving Gotham forever.
 I really thought he would like you.
 What to do now? Please! Please! Not my! Why just smell the fear on your victim when you can taste it, right? Help me! Help! Help! - Hola.
 - Hola, Eduardo.
 - Long time.
 - Yes.
 Just a moment, please.
 Help! Help! Are you on a job? It's not a job if you love what you do.
 Oh, fair enough.
 Listen, um, I'm in a bit of a pinch over here.
 I thought my membership was revoked.
 Bygones, darling.
 Live and let live.
 So you eat people.
 Who am I to judge? The target is a Detective Gordon.
 I'll make it worth your while.
 Send me the address.
 Death squads have softer touches than you.
 At least Galavan goes top shelf.
 The EMTs should be on their way.
 Yeah, sure.
 They'll be here about the same time as our backup.
 So you want to tell me what the hell's going on with you? In the church that day, Barbara accused me of having a monster inside me.
 And? Lee seems to agree.
 She thinks I'm ready and willing to give in to it.
 What do you think? There was a moment.
 When I had the shotgun on Barbara.
 She was taunting me to pull the trigger.
 If Galavan's people hadn't busted in I don't know.
 - But they did bust in.
 - I nearly crossed the line.
 The line.
 Let me tell you something about the line.
 My third tour, we were stationed in the desert.
 We captured three insurgents, when this sandstorm kicks up.
 Zero visibility.
 Then we start taking fire.
 We're getting lit up.
 Suddenly, I'm alone.
 I come across one of our prisoners.
 He's a kid.
 His hands are zip-tied.
 But he figures, what the hell, he's gonna use the sandstorm to try to escape.
 So I jump him.
 And I take my gun and I jam it in his mouth.
 I figured it was just a threat.
 Show him who's boss, you know? Next thing I know I just pulled the trigger.
 Blew his head off.
 That kid woke me up every night for years.
 Until I made my peace with him.
 See, I come to find out I'm just a man.
 And at the right moment, a man might do anything.
 Any man.
 There is no line.
 There's just the law.
 That's what separates us from the animals.
 There is no line.
 Alfred? I thought about what you said.
 And you're right.
 Pursuing Galavan on my own is too risky.
 Well, you don't say.
 Best course of action is call Detective Gordon in the morning.
 - Enlist his help.
 - At last, some sense.
 You're thinking of retiring, are you, sir? Yeah, yeah.
 Very tired.
 Right, can I get you anything to eat before you go to bed? No.
 No, thank you, Alfred.
 Right, well, sleep well.
 Oh, and, uh, Master Bruce? I sent that car off that's parked at the end of the lane.
 You know, the taxi.
 Don't worry, I gave him a right good tip.
 I mean, after all, he did drive all the way up here, didn't he? - I didn't call a taxi.
 - You really are the most terrible liar, aren't you, Master Bruce? I will not stop pursuing this, Alfred.
 I'm never going to give up.
 And nor will I.
 Good night, sir.
  The fire has gone out   Wet from snow above   But nothing will warm me more   Than my, my mother's love   I light another candle   To dry the tears from my face  Why are you playing this song? I can bring tears to your eyes and resurrect the dead.
 I form in an instant and last a lifetime.
 What am I? A memory.
 So what? You were humming this under your covers.
 I figure it has meaning for you.
 Every night when I was young, my mother would sing that song to me when I was going to bed.
 And every time, she would tell me Oswald don't listen to the other children.
 You're handsome and clever.
 And some day, you will be a great man.
 She said that every time.
 That's all I have left now.
 Memories.
 And they're like daggers in my heart.
 Not forever.
 These were Ms.
 Kringle's.
 It's all I have left to remember her by.
 But when I look at these, I don't feel sadness anymore.
 I feel gratitude.
 And do you know why? No.
 And I don't care.
 This little visit is over.
 I will just simply bid you adieu.
 Mr.
 Penguin.
 For some men, love is a source of strength.
 But for you and I, it will always be our most crippling weakness.
 - Move aside, Ed! - We are better off unencumbered.
 - What did you say? - You said it yourself.
 Your mother is dead because of your weakness.
 But what you need to realize is that your weakness was her.
 My mother was a saint! The only person who truly cared about me, and now she's gone! And I have nothing left! A man with nothing that he loves is a man who cannot be bargained.
 A man that cannot be betrayed.
 A man who answers to no one but himself.
 And that is the man that I see before me.
 A free man.
 Are the EMTs with you? Captain Barnes needs immediate attention.
 Ambulance is still inbound.
 We'll secure the perimeter Wait, wait, hold on! Behind you! Officer? Officer?! Hola.
 Detective Gordon, I presume? - Who is this? - This is Eduardo Flamingo.
 Is that name supposed to mean something to me? Not yet.
 But it will.
 I'll be upstairs in a few minutes.
 I'm going to feast on your friends first.
 Save you for dessert.
 You try to run, I will find you.
 I won't.
 In fact, I'm coming down.
 What the hell is going on down there? We've got another hit man.
 He's just taken out all of our backup.
 I'm going down to end this.
 You He just killed four cops! You're not going anywhere on your own.
 He's right.
 I'm coming with you.
 No, you're staying here.
 You need to make sure he doesn't bleed out.
 I just said you're not going down there solo.
 We'll make them come to us.
 We stay here, we're sitting ducks.
 He's after me, boss.
 Go.
 Oh, baby.
 You disappoint me.
 You have the right to remain silent.
 I suggest you use it.
 I'll make sure he gets processed and put in lockup.
 Thanks.
 And, Parks you did good today.
  For my mother looks over me.
  And again!  The fire has gone out   Wet snow from above   But nothing will warm me more   Than my, my mother's love.
  What happened to that gentleman you had tied up earlier? Galavan's lackey? Why do you ask? My mother always said a party is not a party without entertainment.
 Sneaking out to see your girlfriend, huh? Selina, what are you doing here? Saving your ass from making a big mistake.
 Silver is bad news, Bruce.
 - You've said that before.
 - This time, I have proof.
 You interested? You're going away for a long time, Mr.
 Flamingo.
 Get up! I said get up! Lee Hold still.
 Thank you.
 I almost crossed the line tonight.
 No kidding.
 How out of character.
 Scared me a little.
 Welcome to my world.
 Why the hell are you with me? Beats me.
 Just tell me the truth.
 Always.
 I promise.
 Uh-uh.
 Detective James Gordon's phone.
 This is Lee Thompkins speaking.
 Hi, Alvarez.
 I'll tell him.
 Eduardo Flamingo killed Officer Parks before they could get him into lockup.
 Hit men? You sent hit men after Jim Gordon, after I expressly told you to do nothing until I gave you orders? Nothing.
 Tell me this isn't about Barbara.
 He hurt her.
 I'm disappointed that you let a woman like that get in your head.
 If you're feeling upset, find yourself a nice librarian to torture.
 That always cheers you up.
 Everything is ready.
 The brothers' arrival is imminent.
 Bruce Wayne will die, and his company and this city will be mine.
 Ours.
 Everything that we have worked for for so long will be ours.
 Endanger that prize again, and though it breaks my heart, I will cut your throat.
 Welcome, brothers.
 Welcome.
 Hey! Docks are closed.
 I need to see some I.
D.
 Wait No!   

                



                


                    			1 - Previously on Gotham - I set a bomb.
  - Thousands of people could die.
 - Yes.
  But paying that price will be better  than releasing what's down there.
 There's a secret council in Gotham.
  It's them that wanted me dead.
  We're so close to the ultimate truth.
    Strange, you did a very bad thing to me.
  - And now, you're going to -    Impossible.
   Nothing is impossible.
    Thank you.
  Bruce, I might not see you for a while.
  - Where are you going? - I have to find Lee.
              Hello?  We're closed.
  If you leave now,  I won't call the cops.
 Hey.
  Any chance you want to come quietly?      -  -   Ow.
15 this evening,  an individual robbed a pharmacy and attacked its owner.
  While we don't have an I.
D.
 as yet,  we believe this individual is another escapee from Indian Hill.
 Captain Barnes! Captain Barnes!  Valerie Vale, Gotham Gazette.
  Why can't we see the escapee?  Because crews are still picking up the pieces.
  This isn't the first time  that a bounty hunter has apprehended an escapee.
  Is the GCPD incapable  of handling this threat themselves?  Whoa, only a handful of these escapees have been brought in  by bounty hunters.
  The vast majority were apprehended by GCPD.
 Excuse me.
 Excuse me.
  I take issue with the word threat.
  These escapees are themselves  victims of Hugo Strange.
  Now, if any ordinary hard-working citizen  wants to help get these poor souls off the street  so that they may receive proper treatment,  well, these citizens should be lauded  and rewarded financially.
  Mr.
 James, before they were taken to Indian Hill,  these poor souls were all criminally insane inmates  at Arkham Asylum, were they not?  Next question.
  Hear that? You should be lauded.
  I'll settle for the cash.
  How many escapees you brought in now?  - Hmm? Six? - Five grand a pop?  That's not too bad.
  What happens when there aren't any more?  I don't think Gotham's running out of monsters anytime soon.
  I really can't get you to come back, huh?  Look, whatever happened when you went to see Lee,  and you know I don't like to pry  Sure you don't.
  That's because you won't tell me anything.
  The whole point is man's not supposed to be alone.
  - You have a family here.
 - Can't do it, Harv.
  But you got no problem chasing down Strange's freaks?  Yeah, it pays the rent.
  You are a cop in everything but name.
  Yeah, except I don't have to listen to Barnes.
  I get to go home when I want, get drunk when I want.
  And at the end of the day, I sleep.
  'Cause saving Gotham's not my job anymore.
  Jim, I love you like a brother,  but you've got to stop blaming the job  for what happened between you and Lee.
  And do you really  think I don't get drunk when I want?  Detective Bullock?  I looked into the drug the escapee was after.
  It's a powerful immune suppressant.
  Gordon.
  See, look at Lucius here.
  Our new resident expert on all things scientific.
  He said sayonara to the Wayne Enterprises  robots, hmm, and he loves it here.
  Wayne Enterprises revealed itself as morally corrupt.
  Here, despite the primitive facilities,  casual violence, fascistic meathead culture  Lucius?  I love it.
  Anyway,  that drug is only sold at three pharmacies in the city,  and the other two pharmacies were both robbed in the last month.
 Good question.
  So, what do you say just like the old days you  and me run it together Huh, partner?  You get a hard lead on an escapee  and the price is right, I'll bring him in.
  Thanks for the drink.
  Lucius.
  Fascistic meathead culture?  I mean, you couldn't try to be just a little bit more positive?  - I was very positive.
 - Uh-huh.
  Why is Hugo Strange the only one that's been arrested?  - The situation - And what about the rumors  that Indian Hill is a Wayne Enterprises facility?  And how many more of these escapees are at large?  - Are we talking 20? 30? - Excuse me, excuse me  Just give me a blink if I'm close.
  The situation is firmly in hand.
 Liar!    Oh, no.
  My name is Oswald Cobblepot.
  We know who you are, Penguin.
 What do I want?  I want you to tell the truth to the people of Gotham.
  They would have us believe that there is no danger.
  But I was there the night  those creatures broke out of Indian Hill.
  I saw them.
  And I saw who's leading them.
  Are saying the escapees are organized?  Hello! That is what I am saying.
  There is absolutely nothing to support that.
  I told the police who to look for.
  I begged them time and again.
  And they have done  nothing.
  And so I am here  to speak directly to the good people  of Gotham.
  The enemy's name is Fish Mooney.
 Fish Mooney? She hasn't been spotted  for over six months.
  She's either long gone or she's dead.
  I wish I shared your simple belief.
  She is a criminal.
  She is a murderer.
  And now God knows what kind of monster  Hugo Strange has turned her into.
  I implore every citizen of Gotham,  if you love your family,  if you love your children,  find Fish Mooney.
  Until then, no one is safe.
    Hello, Jim.
  Oswald.
  I'm surprised you haven't found Mooney.
  I hear you're quite the bounty hunter these days.
  You haven't made it worth my while.
  Oh.
  Tough guy now.
  But he makes a point.
    I know what boys like   I know what guys want   I know what boys like   I got what boys like   I know what boys like   I know what guys want   I know what boys like   Boys like me   Ozzy.
  Butch.
  What a nice surprise.
  Forgive me for not coming sooner.
  The place looks marvelous!    - Wouldn't you say so, Butch? - Yeah, place looks great.
  I imagine you're here about your offer.
  To let us shelter under your umbrella?  I only want what's best for you.
  I appreciate the thought.
  But we're big girls.
  We can handle ourselves.
  Can't we?  Sure we can.
  Hey, Butch.
  Hey, h-h-how you doing?  You taking care of yourself?  Y-Yeah, yeah.
  So, uh, so how you doing?  You already asked her that.
   Listen.
  You guys should take him up on his offer.
  Gotham's full of rough characters.
  You look great by the way.
  Wait over there.
  Please.
  Poor bunny.
  Break-ups are hard.
  I offered to kill you.
  I thought it would raise his spirits.
  It would be my pleasure seeing as how you murdered my mother!   But he is nursing  some foolish hope that you two will get back together.
  Love.
   You can take your offer and stick it up  We'll think about it, Ozzy.
    Fine.
  But that's not the only reason I'm here.
  Spread the word.
  I want Fish Mooney.
  And I will give a million dollars  to whoever can bring her to me.
  Dead  or alive.
  Chopped into pieces.
  I want her.
  You okay, Butch?    World getting you down?  Yeah, I'm fine, kid.
  And you're too young to be in here.
  - Scram.
 - Jeesh.
  Just trying to be nice.
  Just seeing her kills me, you know?  Get over it.
  And that child just stole your wallet.
    Hey, Barbara and that whip lady  are gonna get angry you stealing from their customers.
  Let them.
 I got other things going.
  - Like what? - Top secret.
  Let's eat; I'm starving.
  Hey, kid.
  Take it.
 It's yours.
 Keep feeding strays, one's gonna follow you home.
 Like you?  Well, that should be the last of it.
  I'll put the kettle on.
  There's nothing like a sweet cup of tea  to make home feel like home after a long trip away.
  Hey, Master Bruce?  You all right?  Were we right to leave, Alfred?  Stay away all this time?  Well, considering the appalling sight of the topiary,  I should say absolutely bloody not.
  Alfred, you know what I mean.
  I know you know why we left.
  We had to leave.
  You're nervous about tomorrow, aren't you?  - Yes.
 - Well, you wouldn't  be human if you weren't.
  So, why don't you go through there, take a pew.
  Pop your feet up,  and I'll see about that lovely cup of tea.
  All right?  Saving that for someone special?  Coffee, please.
    Search continues for new Arkham Asylum director.
  Right.
  Good luck finding anyone to take that job.
  -  - I'm Valerie Vale.
  - Reporter for The Gazette.
 - I know who you are.
  And you're James Gordon.
  Son of a respected Gotham D.
A.
  Former war hero.
 Former white knight cop.
  Now bounty hunter.
  You know, someone should do a story on you.
  - Eh, not interested.
 - Yeah, me neither, actually.
  You were there that night, at Indian Hill.
  - I got nothing to say.
 - What about the fact  that besides Hugo Strange and his assistant,  no one else has been arrested?  Or that despite everything pointing to Wayne Enterprises,  there seems to be zero investigation.
  You're new to Gotham, aren't you?  Okay, this is where  you tell me things work differently here?  I'm not from Gotham, but my dad's a cop.
  My brothers are cops.
  And things work the same everywhere.
  I was going to say it's hard to find a quiet bar  in the city.
  I like coming here.
  Please don't make me find another.
  Now, do you think Cobblepot's right?  That Fish Mooney's organizing the escapees?  Penguin is a liar and a murderer.
  Hmm but  But based on the escapees,  and knowing Fish  I hope not.
  Well  he's offering a million dollars to whoever brings her in.
  You're welcome.
      It's a puzzle.
  The trick is opening it.
  The man at the store said  it's one of the most difficult ever made.
  People pass it down unsolved  for generations.
  A mathematician once went mad trying    Yes.
   Well,  there you go.
   It was a lovely thought.
  And did you got the biscuits?  A-And the sweater?  I-I know how drafty these rooms are.
  - Mr.
 Penguin.
 - Oswald.
  When I think of how I treated you Stop.
  Why are you being so kind?  Talking to you these past months,  I don't know how I would've gotten by otherwise.
  With Fish out there planning who knows what  Me being surrounded by morons and lunatics.
  I know the feeling.
  Why didn't she kill me when she had the chance?  I was powerless.
  She must have a larger goal.
  I-I need to know what she is doing.
  Do you?  When Alexander encountered the Gordian knot,  a knot so complex no one had ever been able to untangle it  he just removed his sword and cut it in two.
   Details can be distracting.
  Sometimes  a simple solution is best.
  See, no matter what she is planning,  just remember  penguins  eat  fish.
  You know why we're here.
  - What are you doing here? - Stop.
  Stop   So what are we after?  It's not like they keep cash around.
  For now, survival.
 Don't move!    Hands.
  Hands.
    Of course.
  Drop the gun.
  Now knock yourself out.
    That was awesome.
 How did you    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Whoa, Fish.
  I'm fine.
  Watch the door.
  Yeah, that's the only company that makes the drug.
  Gray Pharma.
  They actually have a warehouse here in Gotham.
  You think they could be a target?  Well, they're the only pharmacy that carries the drug.
  If somebody wants it, they'll have to go to the source.
  Let me find the address.
  That's all right.
   James Gordon.
  Hands where I can see them.
  So, what?  You're here to collect the bounty Penguin has over my head?  What is it, a million dollars?  And to think I let that punk live.
  Well, then,  I think you better cuff me.
  Cuff yourself.
    How many others you have with you?  They're all with me.
  Every wretched soul  that Hugo Strange experimented on.
  But tonight,  just him.
            Did you hear them rats last night?  Scurrying around in the attic, driving me bloody bonkers.
  I'm gonna ask you,  what's the point of having a caretaker,  if they can't take care of nothing, aye?  You all right, Master B?  Hungry.
  - I should've eaten.
 Excuse me, gentlemen.
  I do this, there's no turning back.
  No.
  You say your piece.
  We'll see about getting you a proper breakfast, all right?    I'd like to thank the board for giving me this time.
  It will come as no surprise  I'd like to talk about Indian Hill.
  I know preliminary investigations have concluded  Hugo Strange acted alone.
  I reject this conclusion.
  While trapped in Indian Hill, I was led to believe  an unnamed group had taken control of my company,  and it was they who hired Hugo Strange.
   I left Gotham  both for my own safety and so that  I might have the time to discover hard evidence  - of their existence.
 Excuse me, Master Bruce.
  Pardon me, sir, might I have your name, please?  - What? - Your name please, sir.
  Crowley.
  Mr.
 Crowley, did your parents ever teach you any manners?  I don't have to listen to this.
  Oh, but you do, sir!  That is precisely the point that I am making.
 I know how it sounds.
  But I now have proof they exist.
  And I can tell you that they're here.
  In this room.
  I want to talk face to face.
  You have 24 hours to contact me, or the information  that I've gathered will be sent to every newspaper  and television station in Gotham.
  Thank you for your time.
  Pancakes?   Pancakes.
 And how did the board react?  Then he leaves us no choice.
  Bruce Wayne.
  Do it quietly.
    People say beware   But I don't care   The rules are just     To me   Me   I walk in a room   You know I look   - You Barbara Kean? - We're closed.
  What?  You built this club on our territory.
  We let you, 'cause we heard Penguin had your back.
  - And now we hear that ain't so.
 - Oh.
  Bad for you; good for us.
    Get the hell out.
  This place is ours now.
  Do you understand?  You can't just come  Don't hit me, okay? Please.
                Hey.
 Hey.
  You still paying for stuff about the Indian Hill freaks?  Depends.
  If it's good.
  Is Fish Mooney good?  - Guess I'm finding a new bar.
 - I heard you ran into  Fish Mooney yesterday.
  - So? - So  are you still interested in finding her?  Every cop in the city's looking for her now.
  But I know where she's gonna be next.
  - Why are you telling me? - You see,  I need something from the cops.
  They're not gonna tell me, but Bullock still trusts you.
  And you want me to lie to him.
  A million dollars covers a lot of sins.
  And obviously, I get to come along.
  Aw.
 Don't tell me you have a conscience.
  Yeah, all right.
  Jimmy, hey.
 So  after your run-in with Fish,  Barnes had us up all night, rousting her old hideouts.
  - Yeah.
 Did you find anything? - Nada.
  But I did get what you asked for.
  Want to tell me what this is about?  It's a hunch.
 Probably nothing.
  Well, if you got a hot lead you don't want to share  so you can collect Penguin's money,  I got no problem with that.
  Just don't get yourself killed or me fired, okay?  I'll do my best.
 Hey, get some rest, huh?  Hey.
  When'd you get back?  A couple days ago.
  I tried to find you before I left.
  No worries.
  You remember what I discovered that night at Indian Hill?  That there was a secret group that infiltrated my company.
  I wasn't paying attention.
  I needed time to research them.
 I couldn't do it here.
  Okay.
  I have a plan, but these people are powerful.
  We need to assume they know you and I are friends.
  You need to be careful.
  - Got it.
 - I'm serious.
  I can see that!  I'm sorry I was gone for so long.
  Don't apologize.
  Shoot, if I could fly to Italy  and eat pizza all day, I would, too.
  - Switzerland.
 - Italy's better.
  - Selina - Bruce, seriously  don't sweat it.
  I got to go.
  I'll see you around.
  Good to see you, Selina.
  - Hey, did you get it? - Yeah.
  She's under guard in a building on Douglas and 80th.
  There's one thing, though.
  Hey.
 Hey!  What the hell are you doing?!  You're 100 yards from a police station.
  I'll be back in an hour or two.
  We had a deal.
  If there's a story, I'll make sure you get it.
  Oh, you're a son of a bitch.
  Also, you could scream, but then you'd have  to tell the cops everything.
  And you'd lose the story entirely.
  Gordon.
  Gordon!  Son of a bitch!    47 this is dispatch.
 This is 47.
  Report to Captain Barnes immediately.
  Relief team will take your place.
 Over and out.
  You got it.
 We're out of here.
        I knocked.
  I didn't answer.
  You alone?  All day, every day.
  I wasn't expecting Jim Gordon to stop by.
  You aren't supposed to be here, are you?  How come you're not in jail?  I agreed to testify against Professor Strange.
  In case you're about to ask,  I don't know who really ran Indian Hill.
  I don't care who ran Indian Hill.
  Then why are you here?  Fish Mooney.
  And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?  No reason you would.
  But it's clear whatever you and Strange did to her  is making her sick.
  Her people are stealing drugs.
  But I don't think they're working.
  She's gonna come after you.
  Or her goons will.
  And they'll lead me to her.
  And how will they find me?  Only the police are supposed to know.
  My guess she'll have someone get the information for her.
  Someone who wouldn't suspect being used.
  Maybe a reporter.
  She'll follow that person or whoever  she goes to for help.
  In this case, a bounty hunter.
  Right  to you.
    You led them to me on purpose.
  You're using me as bait.
  I don't like being played.
  Plus she's worth a million dollars.
 I don't know, which one of you  I want to bat over the head with this cane more.
  I get it.
  Life disappointed you.
  So what? Does that make you special?  I'm done with you.
  You cross me again, I will have you skinned alive  and your head put on a pike.
  And you,  when I came back,  and saw the way you handled things while I was away,  I swear, I had this feeling right here.
  I thought I was having a heart attack.
  But it was pride, Bullock.
  In you.
  The next time I have that feeling,  I'll know it was just gas.
  You both better pray that we find her.
  Get out of my sight.
      I'd say that went well.
  He was right though.
 About me being Captain.
  I did a good job.
 I even liked it.
  Yeah.
 Hey, look, I'm sorry, Harvey.
  I'll do my best to find Peabody.
  Honestly, Jim,  for the time being, I think  it might be better if you just  stayed away.
  Hey.
 Hey!  - Ow.
 - Just tell me, did you know?  Did I know what?  That Mooney was using us to find Peabody.
  You mean using you?  Yeah, it's her kind of play.
  You should've told me.
  Sure.
 Why don't you tell me who your source was?  That's it?  You're not gonna try and find Mooney?  Barnes is on it.
 I've had a long day.
  I'm gonna get a drink.
  Gordon  Nothing.
  - Come on.
 - I said no.
  - Who are they? - Just people.
  They need me to do things for them.
  Well, I can do stuff.
    These are scary people, okay?  - It's for your own good.
 - You just don't want to share.
  Just stay here, all right?  Hello?  What do you want?  I want to talk to her.
  I was following her.
  She was kind to me.
  But then she met him.
 That boy.
  What happened to you?  - You know me? - Uh, yeah.
 I know Bruce Wayne.
  Who is he? Who is he?  What's wrong with you? Let go of me!  Bruce Wayne!  Bruce Wayne.
  Who is he?  Really do not have time for this!  He started it.
 It's a lie!  They cwub is in our territory  Cwub?  What's a cwub?  Cwub.
  What's a cwub? I mean, can anyone understand him?  - Do you know what a cwub is? - Cwub.
   Enough.
  We will work something out.
  Now, this is his territory.
  What are you willing to give him?  Boop.
    That is not helpful.
  Are you telling me you don't see what's going on here?  He is behind this.
  What are you talking about?  He sent this ding dong to squeeze us,  hoping it would send us back to you,  so that he could lord it over Tabby.
  Ain't that right?  That's c that's just that's crazy.
   She's crazy.
  She was in Arkham.
 Hello?  Hello? So was I.
  Is that true, Butch?  -  -   Unbelievable.
    Fine.
 Run your club.
  Just so we're clear,  the only reason you are alive  is Butch.
  The moment he gives the word, you're mine.
    Hello again.
  I know why you brought me here.
  Your body is beginning to reject  the changes we made to your DNA.
  You feel it every time you use  your ability.
  How do I fix it?  Stop using the power.
  Every time you use it,  new cells are activated, and your body rejects them.
  Stop, and you will recover.
  It's that simple.
  It's just  I like the new me.
  I can't fix you.
  I can't re-order your DNA    There's always a way.
  Strange.
 He can.
    He's the only one.
    - Where is Strange? - I don't know.
  They've hidden him somewhere secret.
  Him fixing me is just the beginning.
  I want an army.
  I want an army like me!  And he is going to give it to me.
  - He can't.
 - Oh, he will.
  Or he will die.
    You remember Marv.
  He's one of yours.
  Sort of a fountain of youth  in reverse.
  Good night, Ethel.
 We caught a spy.
  Ivy?  Selina, tell this creep  to let go of me.
  She's my friend.
 I don't like spies.
 - She's not a spy.
  Ivy, what are you doing here?  I followed you the other day, so I knew where you went.
   Bruce Wayne came looking for you,  but he was acting all weird  Who else have you told about us?  - No one.
 - I asked her.
  - Selina - Ivy, shut up!  They're those monsters everyone's talking about, aren't they?  You better tell your friend  to be careful who she calls a monster.
 You better stay away from me.
 Stay away from me!  Ivy!  Ivy!  Ivy!    Watch out!    Help!      Ivy?        Right, once this alarm is set, Master Bruce,  no coming downstairs till the morning, is that clear?  Yes, but was a new alarm system really necessary?  I don't know.
 Was it really necessary  offering a challenge to a shadowy cabal?  Yes, it was necessary, Master Bruce.
 Alfred?  Alf  Alfred!  Alfred, wake up.
  Alfred!        

                



                


                    			Previously on Gotham  Valerie Vale, Gotham Gazette.
 This isn't the first time  that a bounty hunter has apprehended  an escapee.
 Is the GCPD  incapable of handling this threat themselves?  Your body is beginning to reject the changes  we made to your DNA.
  How do I fix it?  Strange.
 He's the only one.
  You remember Marv.
  He's one of yours.
 Hey, kid.
 Take it.
  Keep feeding strays, one's gonna follow you home.
  While trapped in Indian Hill, I was led to believe  an unnamed group had taken control of my company.
  I want to talk face-to-face, or the information that I've gathered  will be sent to every newspaper  and television station in Gotham.
 We caught a spy.
 Alfred!  Alfred!     Bruce.
  You wanted to talk.
    Forgive me.
  Better?  I know you.
  I've seen you at Wayne Enterprises events.
  You've been inside my home.
  My name is Kathryn.
  I represent the group you've asked to speak with.
  You didn't have to hurt Alfred.
  He would not have permitted you to meet with us alone.
  You tried to kill me.
  You were behind Indian Hill.
 Hugo Strange was hired by you.
  Is that why you're here, Bruce?  To ask questions you already know the answers to?  Who are you?  What do you call yourselves?  Our name is unimportant.
  Now,  you made a threat.
  Referring to evidence you'd uncovered of our existence.
  We would like to know what you found.
  Nothing certain.
  Until now.
  A bluff.
  - Nicely played.
 - It wasn't just a bluff.
  The more I studied my company's doings,  the more there were things that could only be explained  by your existence.
  Still, I had to know for sure.
  Now I do.
  And what now?  According to you, we tried to kill you once.
  I began all this because I wanted to solve  my parents' murder.
  Six months ago, I concluded your organization responsible.
  - Have you changed your mind? - No.
  But there are other  considerations.
  Such as your own life.
  The lives of those close to you.
  You're here to make a deal.
  What do you have to offer?  Wayne Enterprises.
  You cannot give someone what they already possess.
  I'm not finished.
  If I die, my shares will be turned over  to the federal government.
  Investigators will comb through every file, every asset.
  Are you prepared for that kind of scrutiny?  That would be unfortunate,  but we would weather the storm.
  - What else? - The Wayne name still has meaning.
  It's a symbol of light and hope.
  For a group such as yours,  I could provide a useful distraction.
  You are an impressive young man.
  Still,  your offer is not sufficient.
  We will also require that you cease  all investigation into our existence  and your parents' murder.
  Any violation of that, in the slightest,  and our agreement is void.
  I need your answer now.
    I agree.
  I'm happy to hear that.
  Needless to say, you will not see me again.
  Good-bye, Bruce.
         Morning.
 Surprised to see me?  Not really.
 What do you want?  - I have a proposition.
 - Not interested.
  Oh, come on.
 Think of it as a way  to say I'm sorry for handcuffing you  to a car door.
 Except I'm not.
  Wow.
 So this is where you live.
  Anyone considering a life in bounty hunting should see this.
  Preferably wearing a hazmat suit.
  You don't bring women here, do you?  All right.
  Fish Mooney.
  Penguin's million-dollar bounty.
  I can help you get it.
  Ooh, see, now you're thinking,  A million dollars,  that can buy me a lot of scotch.
  But, hey, when you're rich, do everyone a favor,  spring for a maid, will you? Or just firebomb the place  and be done with it.
  What's in it for you?  - A story.
 - That's it?  It shocks you that I love my job and I want to be good at it?  Kinda.
  Why not just bring her in yourself?  Why give me a million dollars?  Because I'm a bigger person than you.
  And  because I couldn't find her.
  Ah.
 You lost touch with your source.
  The one working for Mooney.
  I did not lose touch with my source.
  I just have no way of contacting her.
  She always found me.
  Oh, well, that's better.
  It's a million dollars.
  Don't be so damn lazy.
 I mean,  that's your job, right? Your specialty.
 You find people.
  You're a bounty hunter.
  - Who's your source? - So we have a deal?  No handcuffing this time.
  - Who's your source? - She's a petty thief.
  A street kid.
 I like her though.
 She's got style.
  - What's her name? - Selina Kyle.
  You two ever cross paths when you were a cop?  Once or twice.
  Well, that's great.
 So you know where she lives.
  No.
 Not a clue.
  But I know someone who might.
  Oh my God.
  Hello, Barbara.
  Hello, Barbara?  Is that all I get?  - How you been? - Oh.
 How've I been?  Well, see for yourself.
  I mean, it's no art gallery, but there's less chance  of me dying of boredom.
  How's Lee?  We're not together.
  No.
 I thought by now  you would've chased her down, put a ring on it.
  Did you dump her? Oh, I bet you dumped her, didn't you? You're such  - a heartbreaker.
 - I feel like I walked into something.
  'Cause you did.
 Who are you?  Valerie Vale.
 I work for TheGazette.
  - We're working on a project.
 - I bet.
  She your new girlfriend?  - No.
 - No.
    Jim and I were engaged.
  Until I called it off.
  Uh-huh.
 We're looking for Selina.
  Oh, wait, I remember this.
 You kidnapped him  and his girlfriend, held them hostage in a church.
  Aren't you supposed to be in Arkham?  I was, but turns out I'm totally sane.
  Got a paper proving it.
  Yeah.
 Signed by Hugo Strange.
 Again,  Selina, have you seen her?  A kiss.
  That's my price.
  Is she serious? Are-are you serious?  Do it.
  Never mind.
   You're honestly no fun.
  Try her squat down on Drake and Powell.
  That's it? I've already been there.
  She may have mentioned an old bank near Kane Sound.
  Jim.
  I had a dream about you the other night.
  You were in this horrible accident,  and you lost both of your legs,  and then I had to push you around in a giant baby carriage.
  Good seeing you, Barbara.
  Do not.
  So you really think Fish is using the bank as an old base?  If I had to bet, yeah.
  Me, too.
 So how 'bout I call the GCPD,  give them the exclusive,  they take in Fish, and you get squat?    Hey.
 Open the door.
  You should've let me come to find Peabody.
  - Vale! - And, you know what,  - I like your ex.
 - Vale! Hey! Hey!          Hey there.
  You all right?  Thirsty.
  I-I don't have anything on me,  but I live just up the road.
  What's your name?  Ivy.
  My name's Ivy.
  Barnes is gonna want to known where you got this.
  Oh, come on, you know I can't give up my source.
  Don't forget our deal.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  As soon as Fish Mooney's booked,  you get first crack at her,  but for now stay out of the way.
  All right.
  All right, fellas, listen up!  We don't know what we're gonna find in there,  so rule number one is be careful.
  And keep your eyes peeled for Ethel Peabody.
  She's the state witness that was abducted last night.
  I don't have to tell you guys  that this is the call we've been waiting for.
  Let's go in there and end this thing once and for all.
    Oh, we have  company.
  GCPD!  Don't nobody move!                Get Sebring a medic now.
 For months, I warned  the police about the threat to our city  posed by Hugo Strange's freaks, by the murderer Fish Mooney,  and how did they protect you?  They said that Fish Mooney wasn't real.
  That these escapees  were victims who need our help.
  Well, Fish Mooney was real.
  And once she was cornered by the GCPD, finally,  they let her escape.
 Master Bruce, wake up.
  Come on.
  Wake up, Master B.
  Master B, wake up.
  Here you go, sunshine.
  Morning.
   You all right?  How did I get back here?  I don't know; I got the foggiest.
  I mean, I just came in here to call the police  and-and then I found you.
  Alfred.
  You all right?  You all right, then.
  You know, I reckon it was that sameckonit was thate  masked bastard that knocked me spark out.
  I mean, he came in and out without so much as a peep.
  I saw them, Alfred.
  I spoke to them.
  And?  It worked.
  They agreed.
  What, just-just like that?  I mean, you talked about the stuff  that we-we talked about, right?  Yes.
  But I had to promise not to investigate them anymore.
  Not Indian Hill,  not the corruption within my company,  not my parents' murder.
  I see.
  Alfred.
  It was the only way.
  You weren't the only one they threatened, were you?  Hey?  No.
  Do you intend on keeping your word?  Yes.
  I do.
  And how do you know  they will keep theirs?  Hey, Alvarez, where's Bullock?  He's not back from the old bank yet.
  You missed a big payday, Gordon.
  We nabbed five of those freaks.
  Yeah, trusted the wrong person.
  I know the feeling.
  Can we call this even?  You got me.
 I got you.
  It's over.
 Let me buy you a drink.
    Yeah it's over when I get Fish.
  You can read about it.
  I do not want to get in trouble.
  Odd as it might seem, I do enjoy working here.
  I'm just looking to find Fish.
  I do that, everybody wins.
  Fine.
  You know she's sick.
  That's the reason for those drugs  she and the others were stealing.
  That's what Peabody said.
  I figured that was why Mooney was trying to find her.
  See if she could fix her.
  Well  it appears something went wrong.
  This is Ethel Peabody.
  You're sure?  Two separate tests confirmed it.
  You remember there was a body  at the pharmaceuticals warehouse,  a worker ID'd  as 35 years old but who looked a hundred?  I remember.
  So, Mooney kidnaps Peabody,  and then has one of her creatures kill her.
  Why?  Did Peabody give her what she wanted?  She no longer needed her?  It seems unlikely.
  My bet, Peabody simply couldn't fix her.
  Leaving Mooney still searching for the cure.
  You're thinking what I'm thinking.
  There's only one person in Gotham who could help her.
  Hugo Strange.
  Detective Bullock.
  Yeah, that's me.
  Fish Mooney wants to see you.
  All right, all right, all right!  I'm going.
    Hello, Harvey.
  Long time.
  Hey, Fish.
  How you doing?  - Not so good.
 - Sorry to hear that.
  You know, there's a lot of people out there looking for you.
  Yeah.
  I need to find that bastard, Strange.
  Yeah, well, you know I can't help you with that.
  Oh.
  Yes, you can.
  And you will.
  I'll help you find Strange.
  Good boy.
  This is it.
  Nothing special, but it's home.
  You hungry?  Just thirsty.
  Beer?  Pop?  Tea?  Water.
      So sad.
  Poor things.
  My ex-wife left a box of clothes when she moved out.
  You're welcome to them, if you want to change.
  Okay.
  So, where are you from?  Gotham.
  Listen, if you need to use the phone, go ahead.
  Why would I need to use the phone?  Someone's got to be looking for you.
  No.
  - No one.
 - Really?  A beautiful girl like you?  You think I'm beautiful?  So, who are you?  Just a girl.
  Cops killed my dad.
  My mom left.
  I was alone.
  Abandoned.
  But then  something happened and  I changed.
  Grew.
  I'm different  inside and out.
  So sad.
  I'm gonna get rid of that.
  I've never been that good at taking care of things.
  What are you doing?  Relax.
 They're just plants.
  I'll get those clothes.
    You don't know that Mooney has him,  or that she's looking for Strange,  and, again,  you shouldn't even be here.
  Harvey isn't answering his phone.
  Nobody knows where he is.
  Well, you could start by looking  in every place in Gotham that serves booze.
  And we found this  beside his car.
  She's looking for him.
 With Peabody dead,  that'd be her next logical step.
  Damn.
  Damn, damn!  You have to call someone.
  Tell them Fish is on her way.
  Call who? The Feds?  I don't even know which department has Strange.
  But you do know where they're hiding him, don't you?  You and Bullock both know.
  They took him to a place outside the city.
  It's like an old mansion,  but on the inside, it's a high-tech research facility.
  The government has scientists debriefing him, don't they?  They want to know what he discovered in Indian Hill.
  You have to tell us where it is.
  The hell I do.
  I'll take you there.
    Are you sure this is the place?  Yeah.
 This is where I dropped Strange off a few months ago.
  All right, show time.
    Hey, fellas.
  At ease, soldiers.
  Detective Bullock, GCPD.
  - Where's your badge? - My badge?  Oh, man, I must've dropped it.
  I'm here to see Strange.
  We haven't heard anything.
  You haven't? That's strange.
  I mean strange weird, not the guy Strange.
  Do you have ID?  Yeah.
  - Um - Who the hell?  Hold it!  I said hold it!      - Stop right -     Professor Strange.
  You and I have some unfinished business.
  Look at you.
  Amazing.
  You were my greatest creation.
  Your greatest creation who's dying.
  What?  You're going to fix me, Daddy.
  And when that's done,  you're going to make me an army,  so I can have this city kneeling at my feet.
  But I can't  fix you.
 Fish, cops.
 Lots of them.
  You have a few minutes to rethink your answer.
  I'd suggest you do.
            -  - It's Bullock.
  Harvey.
 Oh, he's fine.
  But this ain't Harvey.
 I want to talk to him.
  Sure.
  - You don't control me anymore.
 - Sid.
  Hey, Cap.
 How are ya? Sorry.
  One chance, Mooney.
  You let him go, you might just make it out of this.
  Chump.
  Don't you know you're speaking to a dying woman,  which severely limits your negotiating position?  So here's how it's going to go down.
  One cop comes within 20 feet  of this place, and Harvey,  although I love him, will eat a bullet.
    You had to come back, didn't you?  Like a bad penny.
  Now where were we?  Fish, you got to give it up; you're surrounded.
 Shut up, Harvey.
  What's going on?  - How's Bullock? - Listen up!  I want you to create a full perimeter.
  Snipers on every corner.
  Mooney does not make it out of this.
  Understood?  - Yes, sir.
 - Now go.
  - Captain.
 - What?  You cannot just leave him in there.
  You think that's what I'm doing?  I'm just not charging through the front door  so he gets killed.
  And I'll remind you,  you are no longer a police officer.
  Get in my way, and I'll have you arrested.
    Oh, no, not the press.
  Keep the press back.
  - Keep them back.
 We are standing outside the mansion and preliminary reports  are that wanted Indian Hill escapee Fish Mooney  has barricaded herself inside and is holding a hostage.
  This is it, Butch.
  She's finally cornered.
  Like a rat.
  Yeah, but what are you gonna do?  The cops are already there.
  The GCPD is not Gotham.
  Gotham listens to me.
  It's time to round up our friends.
  Believe me, if I could fix you, I would.
  I think of you as one of my own children.
  But I can't.
  So what am I supposed to do?  Give up?  Do you not understand what you are?  What you represent?  You are the first of a new generation.
  A new Eve.
    You know, I owned a club once.
  Ran protection on the side.
  Every first of the month, people would pay me.
  Every once in a while, someone would come up short.
  And they'd say,  Mooney, I don't have the money.
  Mooney, I need more time.
  And they'd cry and cry.
  And then I discovered that when I squeezed them,  and squeezed them,  and squeezed them,  they always had more.
  You are going to fix me  or I swear to God, I will make you pray  for your death.
    Fish.
 What are the cops doing now?  It's not the cops.
    What the hell is this?  Cordon off this entire area.
  No one gets near the house.
  Cobblepot,  what the hell are you doing here?  What you have proven to be incapable of  time and time again.
  This is a GCPD operation.
  I am ordering you and this mob to disperse.
  - Immediately.
 - Fat chance.
  I will not let those monsters escape again.
 Dammit, Cobblepot.
  One of my detectives is inside.
  This is the last time I'm gonna ask.
  Back up!  You've had your chance, Barnes.
  Now it's my turn.
  Who's with me?    Stay back!        You killed a lot of our friends, Gordon.
  A lot of your friends had it coming.
  - So do you.
 -   That's enough.
  Bring him in.
  Kill them now!  -  - Stay back!  Jim, what the hell are you doing here?  Saving you; I thought that was obvious.
  Oh, yeah.
 Totally.
 Thank you.
 Why are you here, Gordon?  Did your little cop friend send you  to get me to turn myself in?  'Cause that's not going to happen.
  I'm here on my own.
  I only want Bullock.
  Really?  You'd risk your life  for this broken down old thing?  Thanks.
  He'd do the same for me.
  I would, it's true.
  Well, you've helped me,  'cause now I have two hostages.
  Barnes won't see it that way.
  Hell, you kill me, he'll probably thank you.
  I've been nothing but a pain in the ass to him.
  Also true.
  Then you better give me one good reason  why I shouldn't have my friends kill you.
  Because I can get you out of here.
  And exactly how do you plan to do that,  considering this whole place is surrounded?  That's my problem.
  I get you out of here, you give me Bullock.
  That's the deal.
  I get this one.
  - Wait a second - Deal.
  You have two minutes.
  -  -   Jim, you just keep surprising me.
  Shut up.
 How'd you like to have Fish all to yourself?  Don't tease.
  She'll be in the woods behind the mansion in five minutes.
  All you have to do is one thing.
  Name it.
  Cobblepot, get this crowd to disperse,  or I'll make them disperse.
 And there will be bloodshed.
  Promise?!  People of Gotham!  The time for action is now!  Kill the monsters!  Kill them now!    We need all units to the front of the house immediately!      The mob's broken through the front,  but the back is clear.
 We can make it to the woods.
  Time to go.
 You two hold 'em off as long as you can.
  And, Harvey, no hard feelings.
  Fish, screw you.
  Fair enough.
 Jim,  - you can't let her take me.
 - Good-bye, Professor.
  She's going to kill me.
  She's gonna kill me!   Stop!        Go!  That's better.
  Just old friends.
  - Oswald - Don't call me that!  My name is Penguin.
  Do you know how long I've been looking for you?  How long I've waited for this very moment?  Mr.
 Cobblepot  - Quiet! - So this is it?  I spare your life,  and you shoot me dead in the woods like an animal?  Pretty much, yes.
  But I will admit,  that night under the bridge stayed with me.
  Why?  - Why what? - Why didn't you kill me?  I have gone over that night 1,000 times,  and it doesn't make any sense.
  Why didn't you kill me?  I would've killed you in an instant.
  - Answer me! - Because you're mine.
  You were my umbrella boy, remember?  You rubbed my feet  when they were tired.
  And now look at you,  the terror of Gotham.
  Everything I've done in my life,  possibly the best thing  was turning  Oswald Cobblepot into  the Penguin.
  I couldn't destroy that.
  Ask him.
  He understands  what it is to bring something into being.
  It is a part of you.
  Forever.
  Good-bye, Fish.
  Don't come back.
 Penguin! Penguin!  Penguin! Penguin!  Penguin! Penguin!  Penguin! Penguin!  Penguin!    Tell Barnes something, would you?  I'm going home.
      Next time,  remember to water.
 Well, I, for one,  am personally very glad not to be staring  at those bloody box files and that flaming bulletin board,  tramping down those stairs to that dank cave.
  It does leave one question unanswered though, doesn't it,  - Master Bruce? - What's that?  Well, you know, with all this spare time on your hands,  how are you gonna fill it?  Well, I imagine you have some ideas.
  I do.
  Dancing lessons.
  Dancing lessons.
  That's right.
 I mean, a man of your station should be able  to guide gracefully a beautiful young girl  across a dance floor, don't you think?  And I suppose that you're gonna be teaching me these lessons.
  Why, I certainly could.
 You know, I was quite well regarded  as a bit of a dancer in my day, actually.
  Were you?  But I think I'll leave that particular ordeal  to someone more qualified.
 Right.
  Step out.
  Slowly.
  Who are you?  Oh, my word.
  Please don't hurt me.
  You don't quit, do you?  I came by to let you know that tomorrow's paper  is gonna lay out Bullock's story of how Fish got away.
  How she just vanished while you two were escaping.
  Great.
 Can't wait to read about it.
  And it's a load of crap.
  You want to know what I think?  I got the feeling you're gonna tell me either way.
  I think you made a deal with Fish.
  You let her escape with Strange in exchange for Bullock's life.
  And how would I manage that?  I saw Penguin get a call before the riot started.
  When the mob attacked,  Barnes ordered all the cops to the front.
  And that's when Fish slipped into the woods with Strange.
  By that logic, Penguin  helped Fish escape.
 Why would he do that?  'Cause he wanted Fish all to himself.
  I mean, that is what you offered him, wasn't it?  You promised to help Fish escape, but you did it  by double-crossing her and delivering her to Penguin.
  If that were so, I'd be a millionaire by now.
  Except Fish isn't dead.
  Penguin would've dragged her in front of the mob if she was.
  So what happened in the woods?  I don't know.
  I do know  that you're gonna have a hard time collecting all that cash.
  'Course, that wasn't why you did any of this, was it?  Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?  - Wait - Shut up for once.
       

                



                


 Who are you?  - Oh, my word.
 - Please don't hurt me.
  - We caught a spy.
 Gotham listens to me.
  It's time to round up our friends.
 Former war hero.
  Former white knight cop.
 Now bounty hunter.
 Saving Gotham's not my job anymore.
 You are a cop in everything but name.
  Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?  - Wait - Shut up for once.
    -  -         When I count to three,  you will all awake and have no memory  of your animal identity.
  One, two,  three.
    Thank you.
 Thank you.
  A magician? Really?  Hypnotist.
 I like him.
  Plus, the place is packed.
 Be happy.
 Just a taste,  ladies and gentlemen.
  But now let us venture into something more  arcane.
  I'll need a single volunteer.
    Hmm.
  You, sir.
  Beautiful suit.
  - Thank you.
 - Lawyer?  - Uh, doctor.
 - Oh.
  Your mistress?  - My-my wife.
 - Oh, delightful.
  -  -   Listen to the watch.
  The way it's ticking  synchronizes with your heartbeat.
    Look into my eyes.
 but deep into their center.
    You are completely relaxed and are becoming weightless.
  Are you ready to do something impossible?  Yes.
  Stand upon the chair.
    No.
  The back of it.
  Remember, you weigh nothing at all.
    - He'll fall.
 - Not at all, my dear.
    In a hypnotic state, unburdened by doubt and fear,  we can accomplish the impossible.
  Now  one foot.
    So you could get him to do anything you wanted?  Did you have something in mind, Miss Kean?  Jump down, sir.
 Lock sense away.
  Awaken the rascal.
  When I say it is so, your home is my castle.
  Now, I'm going to count down  and clap my hands and you will awake.
  Three, two, one.
  How do you feel, sir?  I feel great.
    - Thank you! -   Thank you.
   Very impressive, Mr.
 Tetch.
  You have quite the gift.
  But you didn't answer my question.
  Can you make people do anything you tell them to do?  Only things they secretly wish to do.
  It's surprising what people wish for,  secretly, deep down.
  - Mm.
 - True.
  You must be a very popular man.
  Oh, I wish.
  Parties like this help pay my way, so thank you.
  And you're new to Gotham?  Yes.
 Just arrived from up north.
  You have a place to stay?  Not yet.
  But something always seems to turn up.
   This is weird for me, too.
  What's-what's your name?  Five.
  Well, 514A, but they call me Five.
  - At Indian Hill? - Yes.
  And how 'bout before that?  I-I don't remember I don't remember anything before that.
  That's convenient, isn't it?  I mean, nothing?  I mean, you must have had a home,  family, friends,  parents.
  If I did, I can't remember.
  I woke up in that lab over a year ago.
  I was locked up the whole time I was there.
  They gave me books, did tests on me.
  Many tests.
  I heard the other inmates in the halls,  but I never saw them.
  Not until Ms.
 Mooney broke us out.
  I'm sorry I surprised you by coming here.
  When-when I saw you  I had to meet you.
  You saw me?  On the rooftop.
  With that girl.
  Selina.
 She gave me money.
  I followed her.
  You're welcome to stay here as long as you need.
  Perhaps we should contact someone with more expertise  in these matters, Master Bruce.
  It's late.
 That can wait until tomorrow.
  I'll make up one of the guest rooms.
 Master Bruce,  we have to get rid of that thing as quick as possible.
  He's a human being, Alfred.
 He's in need of help.
  Look, I-I understand  you feel sorry for the boy, but have a butcher's at him, will you, huh?  I mean, he's you.
 Hugo Strange made another you.
  I reckon it's got something to do  with that secret society or something.
  So what do we do?  Throw him back on the street? I-I want to know  who and what and why as much as you do, Alfred.
  Better he stays here until we find out.
  Fine, but tomorrow we call Lucius Fox.
  Maybe he'll know what to do with it.
 I mean, him.
    - Valerie.
 - James.
  You want some breakfast?  There's a place around the corner.
  Pass.
  I have to be at City Hall in an hour.
  I have to go home and shower.
  I have a shower.
  No, you have a dark hole in the wall  with no water pressure and one damp towel.
  Right.
  Well, I'm collecting my bounty from the GCPD today, so, uh,  I can stop on my way home, make things  a little nicer.
  Yeah, good luck with that.
  That was fun.
  See you around.
  Okay.
 See ya.
 I'm not gonna get all misty-eyed,  but the simple truth is this department has missed you.
  God-given talent like yours is hard to find.
  Your expertise and your professionalism is exemplary.
  I'm very pleased that you're returning to the GCPD.
  Where else can you make a difference like this? Nowhere.
  - I know.
 It's not that - Look   now,  forgive me if I'm, uh,  stepping into a delicate minefield,  but if what you're worried about is Jim Gordon,  he no longer works here.
  No GCPD affiliation whatsoever.
    Hey, Harvey.
  Jim!  Buddy.
 Pal.
 Ha-ha.
  Let's get a cup of coffee.
  I just came by for my check.
  City still owes me for bringing in the last of Strange's creeps.
 Jim?  Hello, Jim.
 What-what are you  Hey.
 You look well.
  Thanks.
  You visiting?  No, we're um, I'm-I'm moving here.
  Permanently.
  With my fiancé.
  He's been offered head trauma position at Gotham General.
  A doctor.
 Good call.
  Captain Barnes has been nice enough to offer me  my old job back.
 Here.
 Um  I haven't decided yet.
  Well, if you did, you'd see me.
  I'm here now and again getting paid.
  It's good to see you, Lee.
  I guess I better get going.
 The movers are due any minute.
  Be well, Jim.
  Jim.
 Lock sense away.
  Awaken the rascal.
  When I say it is so,  your home is my castle.
  Go to the door.
 Who am I?  I haunt your dreams like a ghost,  for I know what scares you most.
  - So you run, run! -   As fast as you can!  There's no escape from the magic man.
    Jolly good.
  Now, get some plastic,  wrap her up and bury her in the garden.
  Oh, and I'm gonna need you to kill yourself, too.
  Chop-chop.
    My sweet sister.
  Alice.
  I've traveled so far.
  So come out, come out,  wherever you are.
 Alice!  Hey! Alice!  -  -     This time, no excuses.
 My money where is it?  I'll get it for you.
  You said that last week,  the week before that.
  I should have known you're a liar.
  - A cheat! - I lost my job.
  Then get another! Don't cheat me!  But, uh, perhaps  we work something out, eh?  If you're a nice girl?  Are you a nice girl?  Stay away from me.
  - Oh, be nice to me.
 - Stop, you don't understand.
   Be nice  Oh!        - I'm so sorry.
 -   You shouldn't have done that.
  You brought this on yourself.
 Since the death  of Galavan, the office of mayor  has been governed by the elected officials  you see behind me.
  This city desperately needs experienced,  seasoned leadership.
  And so, in their wisdom,  they have persuaded me  Much against my will  To resume the office of mayor  until elections can be organized  in the new year.
  Stop!  This proceeding is a sham.
  - Security, remove this criminal! - Criminal?  I was jailed illegally by a corrupt system.
  A corrupt system that was put into place by this man,  who has the audacity  to put himself back into the position that he brought  so much shame and dishonor to.
  How dare you?  No, how dare you  waltz up there and announce yourself mayor?  The people demand to have a say into who will represent them,  - who will protect them.
 Yeah! - It was I  I alone who drove out the monsters that plagued our city.
  Oh, please.
 Where were you then,  while I faced peril at the hands of those abominations?  Sir, are you challenging James's appointment to office?  I most certainly am.
    You better get a close-up.
      To govern this city, one should be legally elected,  which is why I, Oswald Cobblepot,  announce my candidacy for the office of mayor.
 Cobblepot! Cobblepot! Cobblepot!  - Good, good, good.
 -   One more time, one more time.
  - And again.
 -   Good boy.
  One more time.
  Good morning.
 Yes.
 Uh, I don't think  that's a particularly good idea, do you Master Bruce?  Come now, Alfred, I think a little exercise before breakfast  might be just what he needs.
  Fine.
  I'll go easy on you.
 Pop these on.
  Right hand in.
 And the other one.
  Like that.
 All right, step up.
  Now, just remember  Let's see what you got, no, keep your gloves up.
  Protect the chin at all times, all right?  Ready? Here we go.
 Bosh.
  - Ready? -   Come on.
 Sorry.
 Sorry - No,  ab-absolutely fine.
  Let's see if we can do that again.
  Here I come.
   Bloody hell.
  Who taught you how to do that then?  No one.
  If they did, I I don't remember.
  Right, well, let's see what you got, sunshine.
  Here we go again.
 Here we go.
 Oh.
  Oh, dear.
 I'm frightfully sorry.
  What for?  - Your nose.
 Didn't you feel it?  No.
  Should I?  Right, well, I think that's, uh  quite enough for today, don't you, Master Bruce?  Here you are.
  Press that hard against your nose.
  All right? Here you go.
  Stem the flow.
  Good lad.
  Well, that's a very nasty scar.
  Where'd you get that? Or can't you remember?  What did they do to you in there?    Good day, Mr.
 Gordon.
 How'd you find me?  Oh, you're famous, sir.
  Your name's in the papers.
  The fearless bounty hunter.
  I want you to find my sister.
  We're very close.
  We lost our parents at an early age.
  I became her guardian.
  But her condition proved  too much for me.
 I sought help.
  The worst kind.
  The fiend, Professor Strange.
  Her condition?  Some poison in her blood.
  Very rare.
 Unique, in fact.
  He took her in.
  Said she needed constant supervision.
  He wouldn't let me see her.
  You go to the police?  Useless.
  This is Gotham after all.
  The years passed and I lost hope.
  But then I heard about the breakout.
  I assumed she escaped with others.
  But now she is out there.
  Alone.
  Afraid.
  Indian Hill escapees get five grand from the GCPD.
  You able to top that?  I'll double it.
  I'll see what I can do.
  Thank you very much.
  Leave your number.
  You've seen so much pain and tragedy,  Mr.
 Gordon.
  I hope it hasn't left you too alone.
 I'm not being negative.
  I'm just saying, it's a big step.
  - Holy crap.
 -   Headquarters, let me just say one thing first.
  Gotham is rife with crime, Butch.
  Who better than a criminal to clean it up?  Okay.
 Look,  you know I've faced the worst Gotham has to offer,  but politicians, they scare me.
  The people of Gotham are with me.
  They are scared, which means angry.
  And who have they got to turn to?  Aubrey James?   Please.
  That man is a hack.
  This is my opportunity to create a legacy.
  One that my father would be proud of.
 Mr.
 Cobblepot? - Oh.
  What do you think?    You got my vote.
    Mr.
 Cobblepot, I have Aubrey James.
  He'd like to meet you, alone.
  Hmm.
  What are you looking for?  The scars on your back are distinctive.
  I was hoping to find a reference,  - a clue as to why they were made.
 -   You need to hide.
  What?  She won't understand.
  What are you doing?  Homework.
  Is something wrong?    Ivy's missing.
  She'll turn up somewhere.
  Doesn't she always?  This time, she fell.
  And it was a long way down into water.
  And maybe she survived.
  I got a bad feeling.
  No offense, but  it's not like you to care.
  She had nothing, that kid.
  I was it.
  No one else would even talk to her.
    I shouldn't give up, right?  Maybe take one more look at the shelters,  our favorite hiding spots?  Sure.
  Good idea.
    Will you come with me?  If I had a car, I could get around much quicker.
  Uh, yeah, I mean no.
  - No.
 Not-not right now.
 I just - What?  That's too much to ask?  After everything I've done for you?  - Selina, it's not like that.
 I -  Forget it.
  It was stupid of me to even come here.
  Sel I just It's-it's just not a good time.
    You're a selfish son of a bitch.
 You know that, right?  I'm sorry.
  I'm sorry.
  I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
  Selina?  What do you want? I'm looking for someone.
 I think you may have seen her.
  And if I have, why would I tell you?  She's in trouble, and I can pay you.
    I don't need your money.
  - So what do you need? - Ivy.
  She's missing.
  - For how long? - Too long.
   Just keep an eye open for her, would you?  Will do.
  She's from Indian Hill.
  Yeah.
  I saw her with Mooney, but only for a day or two.
  Last I heard, she got a job at The Narrows Bar.
  All right.
 Thanks.
        Who the hell are you?!  You a cop?  Nope.
  Well, if you're looking to rob the place, you're too late.
  Fire took everything I had.
  I'm looking for someone.
  Her name's Alice.
  This some kind of joke?  No.
 What's funny?  That crazy bitch is the one who started the fire.
  - Why'd she do that? - How the hell do I know?!  Said she cut herself.
 Clean yourself up then, I say.
  You don't understand, she says.
  My blood is on the counter.
 Next thing I know,  the whole damn kitchen's in flames.
  Someone's got to pay for this damage.
  You tell me where she is, my client will pay.
  - Who's your client? - You know where she is?  If I did, would I be talking to you?  Thanks for your time.
  - I say when we're done.
 -   Time to teach you some manners.
      - You had enough? -   Not yet.
        Now I have.
      (indistinct announcement over P.
A.
)  I'm sorry for the delay.
  Gotham Friday nights keep us busy.
  - How you feeling? - Uh.
 I'll be fine.
  Might want to take your shirt off.
  Don't want to bloody it up.
  (indistinct announcement over P.
A.
)    James Gordon, the policeman.
  Used to be.
  I don't need to tell you  it's gonna hurt a little bit.
  There we go.
  Oh.
 Yeah.
  Lee speaks very highly of you.
  I'm Mario, Lee's fiancé.
  That's nice of her.
  Look, Jim,  I don't know where your head's at with all this,  but I want you to know that I love her very much.
  I'm gonna take good care of her.
  Good to know.
  So we're okay?  Yeah.
 sure.
  Why wouldn't we be?  Lee and I are old news, water under the bridge.
  Won't get any problem from me.
  Uh wish you both nothing but the best.
  Thank you.
  All done.
  But, uh  you ever were to hurt her,  I'd have to hunt you down and kill you.
    Hey, uh, look, um,  about three days ago, a girl might have come in here  with burns on her.
  Ring any bells? I need an address.
  Look familiar?      A public place.
 Smart.
  Knowing your flare for the dramatic,  I felt it necessary.
    How flattering.
  But why exert myself needlessly?  The public sees me as a man  of action, of change.
 You  You are yesterday's sad joke.
  While Galavan humiliated this city, where were you?  In a warehouse with a box on your head.
  You're an unstable lunatic, Penguin,  and people are gonna see right through you.
  I've got the judges, the unions, the GCPD,  and a whole team of legal experts behind me.
  What do you got?  I have me.
    You're psychotic!      Not this time, Penguin.
  My head will not be put in a box again.
  Oh, you.
  So smart.
 Always one step ahead.
    Never three.
  Relax.
 I do not want you dead.
  Besides, what kind of fun would an election be  if I were the only candidate, huh? Oh.
  You're right about one thing, though.
  I do need a little help,  and I have just the right person in mind.
 Any of his blood get on you?  No.
  Hello, Alice.
  I wasn't sure how he turned.
  Turned? What's wrong with him?  He's infected.
  Infected with what?  With me.
 Who are you?  Why are you here?  Your brother's looking for you.
  He can't find me.
  Alice.
 He's gone.
  He's taken some of your clothes  and the keys to the Roller.
  Cut his hair, too.
  To look more like you.
  We have to go after him.
 I'm not sure  who scheduled this meeting, Mr.
 Cobblepot,  but as you can see, I have been burdened  with restoring order to this facility,  and that is no easy task.
  A man of your reputation should not have been sent here  to clean up Strange's wreckage.
  Indeed.
  Get off me! Let me go!  You are aware of my ambitions?  -  - For office?  Oh.
  Once mayor, I will grant you  whatever position you care to request.
  Gotham's Head of Psychiatry,  a chair on Gotham's Board of Health?  In exchange for what exactly?  Even though my victory is inevitable,  I fear my campaign is missing one key element.
  A colleague of mine is locked up here.
 Unfairly.
  Are you suggesting that I release a convicted criminal  out onto the street?  Well, yes.
 For your betterment.
  That would take extensive  patient analysis, uh, probational hearings,  - appeals -   MAN (over P.
A.
 Lockdown is now in full effect.
  Repeat, lockdown  Of course, there's always plan B.
  - I give you nothing -   but I make sure you remain here forever.
  Not as a warden, no.
    I would see you scrub floors  and empty inmates' latrines.
  Oh  Options.
      Look into my eyes.
  Not around them,  not above them, but into their center.
  - Now sleep.
 -     Now, what would we like to see  the lovely Miss Kean do?  Physical feats?  A trip into her psyche?  She said we needed more whimsy.
    Barbara?  When I count down from three,  you will find me irresistible.
  You will be madly  in love with me.
    Three  two  - one.
 -   Barbara?  Do you care for me?  Oh, yes.
  -  - Do you love me?  Very much.
 Ooh - But  what if I can't feel the same?  - Oh, dear.
 - What if I love another?  I'm sorry,  Barbara, my dear, but    Three, two, one, awake.
  She's a bit sensitive to rejection.
    Ladies and gentlemen, the great Jervis Tetch.
 Bravo!      - Did you find her? - I found her.
  Lost her.
  She shot a man and set fire to his body.
  Said she had an infection.
  Also said, she doesn't want anything  to do with you.
  You want to tell me what the hell is going on?  It's complicated.
  My next stop will be the GCPD.
  You can explain it to them.
  Please, don't do that.
  Let's talk somewhere private.
  Allow me to explain the situation.
    So what does Alice have in her blood  that makes it so infectious?  -  - She doesn't look sick to me.
    She's not sick.
  - She's powerful, sir.
 - Powerful how?  - I need answers, Tetch! - You deserve some.
  Do you hear my watch ticking?    Yeah.
  Listen closer.
  The ticking,  it synchronizes with your heartbeat, yes?    Look into my eyes.
  Not above them, or around them,  into their center.
  Are you asleep, Jim?  Yes.
  Show me.
  Take out your gun and put it on the ground.
  Good.
  Now walk to the edge  and climb onto the wall.
  Been such a long,  hard road for you, Jim Gordon.
 Yes.
  Now you can rest, Jim.
  Close your eyes.
  Sleep forever.
 Deep down, you want to die, Jim.
  You want to end this miserable,  empty, loveless life, don't you?  - Yes! - Yes.
  Let me help you.
  I'm going to count to ten.
  When I reach ten,  you will simply  step off the ledge  and you will find everlasting peace.
  Ready? Yes.
  One.
  Two.
  Three.
  Four.
  - Five.
 - Stop!  Alice?  Thank God!  At last, I've found you!  Tell that man to get off the ledge.
  Never mind him.
  - Put down the gun.
 - Mister!  Get down!  He can't hear you.
  Don't come near me.
  Why are you here  if you don't want to talk?  Put the gun down, Alice.
  You're evil.
  Leave me alone!  Or I'll kill you!  But, Alice, I love you.
        Thank you.
      I'm sane.
  Absolutely.
  100%.
 I examined you myself.
  And the murder of Miss Kringle?  Committed while you were insane.
  - Officer Dougherty.
 - Insane.
  - Officer Pinkney.
 - Insane.
  - And now I'm - Sane.
  And not responsible for any of the acts  perpetrated during your sickness.
  You're a free man, Edward.
  Not to look a gift horse in the mouth,  but how did you    Never mind.
    Hello, old friend.
    Still thinking about your meeting with Jim?  No.
  There's nothing left to say.
  It's all in the past now.
  It's been less than a year.
  I think there's plenty to say.
  After all you went through with him,  I just need to know that nothing's left unsaid.
  Well, you should speak to him yourself, then.
  - I did.
 - You did?  - Mm-hmm.
 - Something you could have mentioned  the moment we sat down.
  When? How?  It's not like I wasn't gonna tell you.
  He came into the ER, he needed stitches.
  Of course.
  So I took the opportunity to introduce myself.
  He didn't make the connection at first, because, um  you hadn't told him my name.
  It never came up.
  Right.
 Did I enter at a bad time?  Glad you could make it, Dad.
  I'm honored that you invited me.
    When Mario was born,  I promised my wife  that he would never be part of our thing.
  That we'd raise him to lead a good, honest life.
  And we did.
  And he has.
  He can't use the Falcone name,  but he's brought true honor to the family.
  My wife is looking down on us now,  and she's so proud and happy.
  She would love you, Lee.
  You're exactly the kind of woman  she would have wished for her son.
  Thank you.
  There's only one thing that would've worried her.
  Oh?  My wife would say you're a little too beautiful.
  All the great tragedies start with a face like yours.
  Makes men fall in love when they shouldn't.
  Makes them do crazy things.
  Dad, really?  You're referring to Jim Gordon.
  I've spoken with him.
  He's moved on.
  I'm fine; he's fine.
  We both have.
  You've got nothing to worry about.
  Here's to both of you.
  A blessed union.
    What the hell are you doing here?  I wanted to apologize  for the way I treated you last night.
  I'm sorry.
 I was insensitive and rude.
  Hmm.
  Does Alfred know you have his car?  No.
  Why tell him? It's mine, not his.
  Would you like to go for a ride?  Are you hungry?  What's with you?  You seem  different.
  Is that a bad thing?  Mm.
  I could eat.
  Don't wait up, losers.
     

                



                


                    			- Previously on Gotham - Listen to the watch.
  with your heartbeat.
  Stand upon the back of the chair.
  So you could get him to do anything you wanted?  I want you to find my sister.
  Her condition, some poison in her blood.
  I announce my candidacy for mayor.
 Hugo Strange made another you.
  - He's gone.
 He cut his hair.
  To look more like you.
 The ticking synchronizes with your heartbeat.
  Deep down, you want to die, Jim.
  Step off the ledge.
  Stop!    You don't understand.
  My-my brother will find out I'm here, and he'll come for me.
  Nothing will stop him.
  This is the brother that took you to Strange  to try and fix you?  What? No.
  Jervis kept me a prisoner most of my life,  and when I finally managed to escape,  I ran as far away from him as I could.
  Mm-hmm, and landed in Gotham.
  It seemed like a good place to hide.
  Until Strange found me and locked me in Indian Hill.
  I'll admit, not the best luck for you or your future landlord.
  That was an accident.
  The infecting part or the lighting him on fire part?  I'm not a monster!  But if you want to see one,  just wait until my brother comes for me.
  You don't know what he's capable of.
  This isn't over.
  For either of us.
    It's perfect!  Oh, my sister used to love amusement parks.
  The rides, the food, the tents with amazing acts.
  That's why I became a performer.
  Are you a family man?  Yes.
  I am a family man.
  The day I lost her was the saddest of my life.
  The only thing that got me through,  that kept me sane,  was the hope of one day being together again.
  Reunited.
  And if all goes well,  that day is today.
  Of course, a reunion like this  needs to be a private affair.
  You understand.
 Why don't you take care of it.
  Appreciate it.
  Thank you.
 I must say, you are looking  quite the dapper fellow.
   I had to guess on the jacket size.
  - I hope it fits.
 - Perfectly.
  I cannot thank you enough.
  It's just a suit.
  No.
 No, if it weren't for you,  I would still be falling asleep to the screams of the insane.
  It becomes almost a white noise after a while, doesn't it?  It does.
  I do believe, Oswald,  Arkham has made us both stronger.
  I couldn't agree more.
  Which is why I had  our release certificates framed.
  A reminder of past struggles  and new beginnings.
  If I didn't know better,  I'd accuse you of being a sentimentalist.
  Guilty.
    You all set, boss? Busy day today.
  Who were those people you were speaking with?  Don't worry about it.
  Come now, Butch.
 Play nice.
  We're all on the same team here.
  Right?  My team.
   Yeah.
 Sure.
  Whatever you say.
  You keep your nose out of my business.
 Yeah.
  Sure.
  Whatever you say.
    Why is it that every time  something hits the fan around here,  I inevitably find you at the center of it?  I was just working a job.
  Her brother asked me to find her.
  Yeah.
 You're some sort of P.
I.
 now? Is that it?  I'm whatever pays the bills.
 Great.
  What do we know about this girl's blood?  Not much.
 She claims infecting the landlord was an accident.
  Have Thompkins draw some samples,  see if she can find out what we're dealing with here.
  And pick up the brother for questioning.
  Any idea where we might find him?  No.
 But when I do, I'll let you know.
  We have some unfinished business.
  Not anymore.
  This is an active investigation.
  You go anywhere near him, I'll have you arrested.
  For what?  No law against two private citizens having a chat.
  I'll come by later to pick up my check.
  I bet I'd make a kick-ass P.
I.
  Get out.
  Have you had this condition since birth?  Tell me about it.
  If a person comes into contact with my blood,  it changes them.
  It affects every person differently.
  My brother believes it brings out a person's true nature.
  Is your brother infected?  Is that why you're so terrified of him?  Jervis isn't infected.
  He believes we're connected.
  Two sides of the same coin.
  My way is the blood, and his, the mind.
  Hypnosis.
  It goes way beyond that.
  He preys on fear,  anger, regret.
  And if he gets in your mind  you're doomed.
 Vote for Oswald Cobblepot,  your next mayor of Gotham! Vote for Cobblepot.
  Here you go.
 Cobblepot for mayor.
 You are so very tired of life, aren't you?  Do you hear my watch ticking?    Hard road for you, Jim Gordon.
  Listen closer.
    You are so very tired of life, aren't you?  Now you can rest, Jim.
 Right, yes.
 Well, will do.
 Thank you very much.
  Good-bye.
  Well, that was the impound yard from downtown.
  It appears the Rolls  was towed only this morning, Master Bruce.
  This doesn't make any sense.
  - Why would he leave? - Well, he cut his hair  to look more like you, if that's even possible.
  You think he went to the city to pretend to be me.
  - Yeah, absolutely.
 Bloody yes.
 - So where would he go?  Take in a show, do a little bit of shopping, have a facial?  I mean, where do pain-resistant clones  of multibillionaire teenagers normally go?  - Alfred.
 - Well, I don't know.
  The car was found at 11th and Dillon, wasn't it?  That's in the Narrows.
  So I suppose we should be thankful there's anything left to tow.
  What in the dickens was he doing down there in the first place?  Selina.
  11th and Dillon is near her apartment.
  Sorry, again, for the way I acted  when you came by yesterday.
  Any word on your friend Ivy?  No.
   I even braved a beat-down from Sonny to see  if she was growing magic mushrooms for him again.
  - Magic what? - Mushrooms.
  Sonny Gilzean.
  Pounded you to within an inch of your life.
  Yeah.
 Sonny, right.
  Well, this is it.
  Time to earn a living.
  - You work here? - No.
  I rob here.
  - What? -   The Bang Bang Room is a betting parlor.
  Should be flush today with the mayor's race.
  Meet me around back in five minutes.
  Selina.
 Yeah!  Pay up!    Hey, that guy at the end of the bar  said you're buying the place a round.
   What?  Mm-hmm.
 Oh, and your mom sucks.
  Or something.
  Really?  Hey, wise guy!  Here's your drink!    Get him off me! That's enough!    Who the hell are you?  Sorry.
  My first day.
  Uh  can you help me find the cherries?  No?  Probably behind the bar.
 Right.
  Uh, I'll go check.
  Hey, Squirrel,  what's the odds of a person getting out of here  in one piece?  Not good, boss.
  My beloved mother  always believed in me.
  Even when I doubted myself, she held firm.
  Seeing all of your bright faces reminds me that  there is nothing you cannot do if you put your mind to it.
  And when I am mayor, I believe  no I know that together,  we will Make Gotham Safe Again!    Excuse me.
  Are you on the election board?  Yeah.
  I work for Mr.
 Cobblepot.
  He just wanted me to confirm what Butch gave you.
 May I?  Thank you.
  It's all there.
  Thank you.
  Follow him for the rest of the day.
  Don't let him leave your sight.
   Well, look who's back.
  I saw you last night.
  You didn't even say hi.
 Rude.
  - I need to find Jervis Tetch.
 - Oh, you mean  The Great Jervis Tetch, Hypnotist Extraordinaire?  You believe it actually says that on his business card?  Number's been disconnected.
 Where is he?  I don't know.
  Magic shop, bunny farm  Someplace where everyone wears top hats and drinks tea?  -  - Barbara.
  You know, I'm not sure I like this new thing  of you storming in here every time  you need something.
  It's almost like we're married.
  Scary thought.
  I need a favor.
  Oh  Then you must be monumentally screwed.
  What happened? Did he hypnotize you?  Make you bark like a dog?  He's dangerous, Barbara.
  Don't say I didn't warn you.
  Okay.
  He came in here earlier.
  Said he wanted to hire some muscle.
  - Muscle? - Yeah.
  For some performance he's planning.
  Said he needed them to have flair.
  What'd you tell him?  It's Gotham, baby.
  We've all got flair.
  Thanks.
 Always a help.
 Excellent!  Deever and Dumfree, I presume.
  The Terrible Tweeds.
  Your reputation precedes you.
  And you are?  Jervis Tetch.
  I have a job that might suit your particular skills.
  My sister's been taken by the GCPD.
  I need to get her back.
  You want to break someone out of the GCPD?  Not someone.
  My sister.
  I assumed men like yourselves understood the bond  of family.
  What's in it for us?  Does he ever speak?    Regardless, if you'll do the courtesy  of listening to me, I think you'll find  - I can be quite persuasive.
 Place is packed to the gills.
  It's running two to one, for Penguin.
  Mm.
 Sounds like you're busy.
  Maybe I should go, huh?  No.
 This won't take long.
  I hate people with sticky fingers.
  Okay, wait.
  W-What do you what do you need?  Huh? Money? Information?  I could be useful.
  Oh, you will be.
  You'll send a message.
  But maybe  I don't got to do this.
  I mean, maybe  you learned your lesson.
  Yeah, totally.
 I    You're screwing with me, aren't you?  Yeah.
  Do it.
        Bruce?      Let's go.
  And although some have criticized Mr.
 Cobblepot  for running a campaign based largely on name-calling  and fear-mongering   His simple message of  - Make Gotham Safe Again has -   Can you believe Penguin might win this thing?  Whole city's going to hell  in a handbasket.
    You okay?  Fine.
  I assume  you didn't come here to ask about my health.
  I need to speak with Alice Tetch.
  No.
  Five minutes, that's all I'm asking.
  She's scheduled to be moved to a facility upstate.
  I'm sure she'll have plenty of time then.
  This can't wait.
  What's going on?  You can talk to me, son.
  Her brother.
  I had a run-in with him last night.
  Think he may have done something to me.
  Like what?  I don't know.
  I'm having thoughts.
   Look  you've caught some bad breaks.
  Blackgate.
 Lee.
  I don't know what happened when you went to see her,  but I can take a pretty good guess.
  But at some point, you're gonna have to make peace  with the decisions you've made.
  And what if I can't?  Take it from me,  you don't want to wake up one day and realize  that 20 years has gone by.
   We're keeping Alice in interrogation.
  Five minutes.
    What was that back there?  - What? - You.
  Remind me to give props to Alfred on his training.
  I did not think you had that in you.
 Me neither.
  You okay?  You?  A little lightheaded.
  Bruce.
  - Oh You need a hospital.
 - No.
  No hospitals.
  - Are those scars? - Nothing, they're nothing.
  You're not Bruce.
  Selina, just  - You're not Bruce.
 - Just-just listen  - What the hell are you?! - I won't hurt you.
 Just let me  Just let me explain.
  I assume you know Butch is paying campaign officials  to buy the election?  You don't approve?    My dear Ed, this is Gotham.
  This is how things are done.
  And in theory, I support that.
  But, Oswald,  Do you see how these people are cheering for you?  Yes, they do seem very excited.
  You can win this on your own.
  Why risk it? There is no upside.
  I want this, Ed.
 I want this like I've never wanted anything.
  I know.
  Which is why you need to call off Butch.
  Mr.
 Penguin?  Hello, there.
  I wanted to thank you for getting rid of all the monsters.
    Do you see?  People look at me differently now.
  For the first time in my life,  I feel wanted.
  Nice doing business with you.
  And how do you feel now?  I feel like I've misjudged someone  who was supposed to be my friend.
  I am your friend.
  I can't be bought, but I can be stolen with a glance.
  I'm worthless to one, but priceless to two.
  - What am I? - I don't care.
  I do not need a stupid riddle right now.
  I know what I want.
  I want to be mayor.
  Stay out of it, Ed.
  I'm warning you.
  I need to find your brother.
  You turn me in, and now you want my help.
  I was hoping we could help each other.
 I don't know.
  Most of the time,  once the trance is broken, that's it.
  You should've been fine  the moment you stepped off the ledge.
  Then why is it still happening?  Jervis has tapped into something you're struggling with.
  Something a part of you would do anything  not to face.
  Then give me something to fight this until I find him.
  There's usually a trigger that brings on the hypnotic state.
  What's the last thing you remember?  He pulled out his watch.
  Asked if I could hear it ticking.
  That's it, then.
  His watch.
  Anything resembling the ticking will trigger the impulse.
  He's made you a prisoner in your own skin.
  He did it to you.
  When we were kids.
  At first, he did it to control me.
  Keep me with him.
  But then he started  putting other thoughts in my head.
  Thoughts a  Thoughts a brother should never have.
  That's why I wanted to kill him.
  I won't go back to him.
  Not ever.
 Ladies and gentlemen!  It is with great excitement  that we welcome you to our show.
  It's him.
  He's come for me.
  Getting you out of here.
  To wrestling's most notorious family,  here to entertain and amaze!  The Terrible Tweeds.
  Let the show begin!        Harvey, look out behind you!  Hello, sis.
  We both know you can't kill me.
  Not until I remove that nagging  little impulse I planted.
  Turn around, hands in the air.
 Alice, go.
  Now.
  Good-bye, Mr.
 Gordon.
 No!  I doubt I'll be seeing you again.
 Get off me! Let go!   Mr.
 Gordon!  Ugh.
  It really doesn't hurt?  No.
  Whatever they did to me at Indian Hill, I don't feel pain.
  So why'd they make a Bruce Wayne look-alike anyhow?  I don't know.
  I didn't even know I looked like him until a few days ago.
  I went to his house thinking he might have some answers  about who I am.
  He didn't.
  So you ran off and pretended to be him.
  Why?  You'll laugh.
  I doubt it.
  Neither of you has a sense of humor.
  When you came to see him the other night,  I was watching from the hall.
  I saw the way you looked at him.
  No one's ever looked at me like that.
  I wanted to know how it felt.
  You should have your eyes checked.
  I didn't look at him like anything.
  All I mean is that I've never had a friend.
  I've never had anyone.
  You have no idea what it's like to spend your whole life alone.
  You're actually better off.
  People are overrated.
  You don't believe that.
  My mom left before I could ride a bike.
  Never knew my dad.
  I had two friends.
  One ended up barbecued,  and the other's at the bottom of the river.
  What about Bruce Wayne?  Forget about him.
  He's even more screwed-up than you.
  You're more normal than you think.
  Hey.
 You're up.
  What's going on?  Barnes told me what happened during the attack.
  Nothing happened.
  I heard the tape from the interrogation room with Alice.
  Listen to me  Whatever Jervis is doing to you  You need to uncuff me.
  I can't do that.
  I don't know what I would do if something happened to you.
  You'd be fine.
  Do you really believe that?  You seemed to have moved on okay.
  Yes, I moved on, Jim.
  What choice did I have?  I went through the most  painful period of my life alone.
  I cried myself to sleep every night.
  And like an idiot, I would wake up thinking, hoping that  the next day, you would show up at my door.
  But you never did.
  Mario was there for me when I needed someone.
  He was there as I tried to put myself back together.
  But I'm the one who doesn't care.
  After everything that's happened,  you really have nothing to say to me?  The past is the past.
  There's nothing I can do to change that.
  Alice told me that her brother preys on anger and regret.
  I really don't want that to be all that's left of us.
  You mean all that's left of me.
  Barnes asked me to put you on a 48-hour suicide watch.
  I've already signed off on it.
  I know that we can't change the past,  but there's a difference between moving on and letting go.
    Most of you guys have been with me for a while.
  You know me.
  And I know Gotham  like the back of my hand.
 To Butch!    I  What?  I lost track of the guy in the glasses.
  Nygma?  That skinny loon gave you the slip?!    -  - Yeah?  No.
  No, no, that's not possible.
  Let's go!  We got to go, guys! Come on!  Two of your brothers are dead.
  The other two escaped with Alice and Jervis.
  And I need to know where they're taking her.
    Jervis gains a sister and you lose two brothers?  That don't seem too fair.
  Hmm?  I bet you were close growing up, huh?  Wrestling around the house, driving your mom crazy.
  Five little kids all dreaming of stardom.
    Yeah, I'm a fan.
  My dad used to always take me down  to the rassling matches at the Garden.
  I also happen to know most luchadores  request to be buried in their masks  as a sign of honor    and respect.
  I really, really hope that wasn't the case  with your brothers.
    This freak Jervis did something to my friend,  and I need him to undo it.
 Well?  You like it?  I know you were surprised to see me last night  and I want you to know that I forgive you.
  For everything.
  But  I want you to understand consequences  if you ever leave me again.
  I need you to understand how important you are to me.
  Don't.
 Please.
  Now  you might feel  a little prick.
 Your escorts agreed  to take a long lunch.
  - You know where they took Alice? - Yeah.
  But it's only a matter of time until Barnes finds out  and sends in the cavalry.
  How'd you find me?  Lee.
  - Lee? - Yeah.
  She also told me  if you check out on my watch, it's my head.
  Guess you're gonna have to trust me.
  Remember to chisel that into my tombstone.
  Let's go.
  Thanks, Francisco.
      Took you long enough.
  Where's Selina?  She's not at her squat.
  - If you did anything - She's fine.
  - Where is she? - She left a little while ago.
  I don't know where she went.
  I take you in and this is the thanks I get?  You run around with Selina, pretending to be me?  Is that why you're angry?  Because I was pretending to be you  or that I spent the day with Selina?  For someone who has everything,  you have no idea what you actually want.
  Or maybe you're just too scared to take it.
  At least I know who I am.
  Cool your boots, Master Bruce.
  Let's all just take a breath, shall we?  Don't worry.
  You won't be seeing me anymore.
  Neither will she.
  I don't know why I was created,  but I know I don't belong in Gotham.
  Say good-bye to Selina for me.
  And thank her for the kiss.
  What are you going to use that for?  Oh, I imagine I'll  mix it into  some public drinking fountain.
  Create a few dozen monsters.
   Please, Jervis.
  Please.
  - I'll do whatever you want.
 - You will now.
  Because you know the price  other people will pay if you don't.
  I don't know what I would ever do if I lost you.
  That connection.
  It keeps me sane.
  It always has.
    Tetch?  - Jervis? -   Don't move!  Mr.
 Gordon.
 I can't say I'm entirely surprised.
  So stubborn.
  - Let her go now.
 - You know I can't do that.
  But if you let me leave  with my dear sister,  my dear Alice  then I'll free you from that nasty little impulse.
  Maybe you can live a long, happy  Well, a long life.
  Let her go and you live.
  That's the deal.
  One question.
 We both know what you really want.
  I saw it in your eyes the first time  we met.
 You want to be free.
  Free from the pain.
  And you can be.
  Stop fighting  and let go.
 The past is the past.
    There's nothing I can do to change that.
 There's a difference between moving on and letting go.
  No!  Well, well, Mr.
 Gordon breaks my spell!    I daresay it's time we bid this foul city our good-bye.
 No! - Alice!  I'll never go with you!  Why do you say such things?!  We belong together.
 You know that.
  I love you.
 No!  You killed her!  You want to explain yourself?  I was following a lead.
  You were following some misguided notion  about friendship.
  James Gordon is gonna get you killed  one day, you get that?  Maybe.
  But until that day,  I will never turn my back on him.
 The night that all of Gotham  has been waiting for.
  The final results should be coming in shortly.
  This is it.
  The moment I've been waiting for.
  Indeed.
 Butch, release him this instant!  What is going on?!  I'll tell you what's going on.
  He just cost you the election.
  He went to every district official  and took the money back.
  Said you wanted to run a clean election.
  Tell me this is not true.
  I'm afraid Butch is right.
 For once.
  -  - Why?  After everything I've done for you.
  Everything we could've done together.
  You betrayed me.
  Butch!    Give me one reason why I shouldn't  let Butch kill you where you stand.
  Well, there are about 30 witnesses  I don't care!    And there's that.
 In what can only be viewed  as a seismic shift even by Gotham standards,  former underworld kingpin Oswald Cobblepot  has won the mayor's office by a landslide.
      momentum based largely on his outspoken criticism  I still won.
  Of how city officials and the GCPD mishandled  They really want me as mayor.
  Yes.
  I can't be bought,  but I can be stolen with one glance.
  I'm worthless to one, but priceless to two.
  Love.
 Cobblepot! Cobblepot!    They love me.
  If you would've bought the election,  you would've never known.
  But now you do.
    Feels good, doesn't it?  How did you know I would win?  I believe in you, Oswald.
  Even when you don't believe in yourself.
    You.
  You never believed I could win this election on my own.
  I think maybe you're not cut out for this after all.
  What?! You got to be kidding me.
  - This guy - Don't worry.
  I still need someone to crack skulls.
    Come, Ed.
  We have plans to make.
      You think we'll ever see him again?  Well, that I very much doubt, Master Bruce.
  I reckon he's gonna try and get as far away from Gotham  as he possibly can.
  I still wonder why Hugo Strange made him.
  Long lonely nights  in the laboratory, but wanted someone to talk to.
  Or some other nefarious reason.
  Perhaps.
  There is one thing.
  Yes, Master Bruce?  Do you think Selina really kissed him?  - Aw, bloody hell.
 - I mean, you've had  training in interrogation, right?  You can tell when someone's lying.
  No, I'm not gonna have this conversation.
  And if she did kiss him, do you think she thought he was me?  Good night, Master Bruce.
  I bet she thought he was me.
 Hey.
  Hey.
  You're here late.
  Tweeds really did a number on this place.
  Guess I'm medical examiner-slash-medic.
  Slash-resident therapist.
  I wanted to thank you  for telling Bullock where to find me.
  Heard about what happened with Alice.
 You okay?  - Yeah.
 - No.
  I mean are you okay?   Whatever Jervis did to me  it's over now.
  I'm glad.
  Guess I should get going.
  Lee.
  There's something I need to tell you.
  Something I should have told you  the moment I saw you back in Gotham.
  Everything you said today I'm sorry about that.
  Don't  You were right.
  And after everything that happened today  This is harder than I thought.
  What is it, Jim?  I'm happy for you.
  You are?  Trying to be.
  Maybe we can start there.
  Yeah.
  I think we can do that.
  Bruce Wayne?  No.
  But you could be.
  In fact, you could be so much more.
  Who are you?  You might think of us as your parents.
  We've been looking for you for a long time.
    It is with a humble heart  that I accept the trust placed in me by this great city  to become your mayor.
  The people have spoken, and I have heard their call.
    And as my first act as mayor,  I would like to introduce you to my chief of staff,  Mr.
 Edward Nygma!              No.
     

                



                


                    			1 Previously on Gotham  Who are those people you were speaking with?  You keep your nose out of my business.
  Now, now, Butch, play nice.
 If a person comes into contact with my blood,  it changes them.
  My brother he gets  in your mind, you're doomed.
  Good-bye, Mr.
 Gordon.
  - Ivy's missing.
 - She'll turn up somewhere.
  This time she fell.
  It was a long way down into water.
 Maybe she survived.
 What's your name? - My name's Ivy.
  Barnes asked me to put you on  a 48-hour suicide watch.
 I've already signed off on it.
  - He just cost you the election! - Give me one reason  why I shouldn't let Butch kill you where you stand.
 Oswald Cobblepot - There's that.
  Has won the mayor's office.
  I believe in you, Oswald.
  You never believed  I could win this election on my own.
  Maybe you're not cut out for this, after all.
  What?!  - Jervis.
 Let her go now.
 You killed her!  I would like to introduce you  to my chief of staff,  Mr.
 Edward Nygma.
 Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.
  Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.
  He'll make Gotham safe again.
  Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.
  Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.
  He'll make Gotham safe again.
    Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.
  Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.
    Thank you so much, thank you.
 There's something I've been wanting to ask you.
  Am I a good boy?  Have I made you proud?  I hope I'm not interrupting.
  Oh, Ed, you never met my mother.
  Wasn't she beautiful?  A fine figure of a woman.
  She was my whole world.
  The only one that was always there for me.
  Well, I believe the answer is yes.
  She would be proud.
  Do you really think so?  Oswald, look at everything you've achieved.
  The people love you.
  Gangs fear you.
  And tomorrow night, the crÃÂ¨me of Gotham  will be gathering to celebrate you.
  What more could someone ask for?  Someone to share it with.
  My mother was the daughter of immigrants.
  A humble cook.
  We did not have much,  but when she was by my side, I felt loved.
  Protected.
  As promised, I have rid Gotham of its villainous monsters.
    With my mother as my witness,  I vow to you from this day forward,  every man, woman,  and child in our great city  will be safe!        No one is safe.
 Not from us.
  Drop it.
  Put it down.
    You will pay for this!  Dearly!  Now, now, Mr.
 Mayor.
  Don't go losing your head.
    Have a nice day.
   I can't come over tonight.
  Okay.
  I mean, that'd be three nights in a row.
  That'd almost make it a thing.
    The neighbors might talk.
  Exactly.
 And I have a dinner.
  It's not a date.
  None of my business.
  Uh-huh.
  So whatever happened with Tetch?  I told you.
  He broke his sister out of the GCPD.
  Bullock and I chased him down.
  She died.
 He escaped.
  'Cause I heard a rumor  there's something strange about her blood.
  Do you like this?  I think I made that pretty clear.
  Then why are you pressing?  Because I want to know.
  Are you asking as a reporter or as yourself?  Is there a difference?  There should be.
 When you were a cop,  did you stop being one when you came home?  Maybe that was my problem.
  Hmm.
  The guy I'm having dinner with is the hematologist  in charge of analyzing Alice Tetch's blood.
00 if you want to call.
  Thanks for the coffee.
    We found the truck.
    They ditched it in the Narrows.
  We got forensics going over it  and teams doing a ten-block sweep.
  We already found this.
  The Red Hood Gang.
  I thought those idiots were dead.
  My guess is they're copying the look.
  The original Red Hood Gang were bank robbers.
  Whoever they are, they got a beef with Penguin.
  Expand the search to 15 blocks.
  Everything goes through you.
 You mean through me.
  Wow.
 It is good to be back.
  I have missed all of you.
    Harvey.
  Still a stranger to a haircut and a shave, I see.
  What are you doing here, Nygma?  As Mayor Cobblepot's chief of staff,  I'm gonna be your liaison on the Red Hood investigation.
  I want to see all reports.
  I'm gonna need access to your forensic lab.
  You think I'm gonna just let you waltz into my precinct?    You're a cop killer who should be  in the loony bin.
  - I'll be damned - You'll be fired.
  The mayor can't fire me.
  No, but he can appoint  a police commissioner who will.
  So you will carry out  the mayor's orders without question  or the GCPD has a new captain.
  How does that sound?  Every dog has his day, Nygma.
  Enjoy yours.
  And where is our lord mayor?  Hiding under his desk?  He's meeting with constituents.
  Anything for you, my little Cobble Pot.
  You can count on me.
  Those were the words my mother used to whisper to me  every night before I fell asleep.
  She was a saint.
  Yes.
  A saint whose only desire was  to love me.
  And what was her thanks?  Not only did she take a knife in the back  but even in her death, her memory is being desecrated.
  Seriously?  This is the reason we're here?  A little glue.
  Some paint.
 No!  That is not the reason you are here.
  The Red Hoods have challenged my authority.
  They will be made an example of.
  Tonight,  I am celebrating my historic victory  At the Sirens.
  It's gonna be fabulous.
  None of you are invited.
  I want them found and their leader's head  brought to me on a spike before nightfall.
  What are you waiting for?!  Find them!  All right, five-card draw, gentlemen.
  All right, someone didn't ante up.
  Come on, you cheap bastards.
  How long are we supposed to wait?  Long as it takes the boss man to get here.
  You need a lookout.
    Uh, relax, fellas.
  Hey, uh, you want us to deal you in, boss?  We don't have time for games, boys.
  We got work to do.
  Hello, Jim.
  Is it a bad time? I should've called.
  No.
  Please, come in.
      Can I get you something to drink?  - A glass of water? - I'm fine.
  I heard you were back.
  I've been meaning to come see you.
  - Everything okay? - Yes.
  Alfred and I are both well.
  I hear you're a private investigator now.
  I'd like to hire you.
  Uh, Bruce, if this is about corruption  at Wayne Enterprises It's not.
  I've put my investigation into my father's company aside.
  It's time I moved on.
  Why the sudden change of heart?  It's far from sudden.
  I've given it a great deal of thought.
  I can't live my life if I keep looking back.
  For what it's worth, I think that's wise.
  So, what can I do for you?  Ivy Pepper's gone missing.
  I didn't realize you two were close.
  We're not, she's a friend of Selina's.
  And does Selina know you're doing this?  No.
  I don't want to get her hopes up if we don't find anything.
  Well, we'll start with the GCPD.
  See where we go from there.
  I think it's chivalrous, you doing this for Selina.
  How long have you two been a thing?  Oh, no, no, no.
  - Selina's a friend, that's all.
 - Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
  No, really, she's just a friend.
  Yeah, yeah.
  Mr.
 Fox,  just the man I've been wanting to see.
  Oh, joy.
 Mr.
 Nygma.
  Heard you were stopping by.
  I have questions.
  - Hopefully, you have answers.
 - Or what?  You'll poison me with gas?    That gas was a sleeping agent.
  And to be fair, I was not in the best place in my life.
    To be fair,  if you ever threaten my life  or the life of Bruce Wayne again,  I will find a way to end you.
  Mr.
 Fox, we both know you're not a man of violence.
  No, I am not.
  If I was, I would've laced some piece of lab equipment,  one which you were sure to touch, with a toxin.
  Ricin, maybe.
  I'd use Saxitoxin.
 Harder to trace.
  But I like your style.
  You are insane.
  Was insane.
  I have a certificate.
  - So, the Red Hoods? - See for yourself.
    The gang's getaway vehicle was abandoned in the Narrows.
  As you'll notice,  its carpet fibers has elements of dirt, oil,  and, oddly, potassium chloride.
  A halide salt.
  Fascinating.
 So nothing on Ivy Pepper,  but an odd report came in a few weeks ago, okay?  A construction worker claimed  that a redhead knocked him out, robbed him,  and she left this.
  That's Ivy's sweater.
  How do we find this man?  I already called, all right? The guy's down south  on a job, but he swore up and down  that the redhead who rolled him  - was in her 20s.
 So?  He's probably covering for being with a young girl.
  Doubtful he would come forward in the first place.
  Yeah, most pervs don't want to call attention to themselves.
  So it wasn't Ivy.
  It seems unlikely, but why would she have Ivy's sweater?  - Dr.
 Thompkins.
 -   Bruce, it's good to see you again.
  You got taller.
  Like I said, right? The kid's growing like a weed.
  Nice to see you, too.
  Uh, Jim, could I have a word?  Wanted you to hear it from me, um,  my engagement announcement is coming out  in The Gazette tomorrow.
  And it will feature Mario's name.
  I think that's customary.
  His family name.
  You mean Falcone.
  You knew?  You knew and you didn't say anything?  Sure I did.
  I said congratulations.
  - Don't be cute.
 - Lee.
  People talk.
  Was I surprised? Sure.
  But it's also none of my business.
  Your life is your life.
  And I meant what I said.
  Very happy for you.
  So, that's it?  That's it.
  Okay, um, well, I just wanted to tell you.
    Dr.
 Thompkins.
  I had heard that you were back.
  I'm so glad  That's for Kristen.
  You shouldn't have done that.
 Or what?  I'm supposed to be scared of you because you work for Penguin?  My fiancÃ©'s father is Carmine Falcone.
  I so much as whisper to him,  and you disappear.
  Tell the mayor, whatever I can do as M.
E.
, I'm happy to help.
  It's bad enough we're throwing Penguin's party.
  It's good for the club.
  Now we're his errand girls?  Sweetie, we find the Red Hoods, he'll owe us.
  We can ask for a favor, say him not killing you?  Well, it would be nice not to have to watch my ass  all the time.
    Well, well.
  Who do we have here?  Guy calls himself the Ballistic Bomber.
  My contact at the Merc saw him buying  - smoke grenades last week.
 - Ooh.
  Just like the ones the Red Hoods used on Penguin.
  Groovy.
  Reckon he'll talk?  Of course.
  No!  Maybe give him a moment.
 Now remember, kids,  you tell the press this is all Penguin's fault.
    - Good.
 - Yes, sir.
  - Light it up.
 -   - Oh, mercy.
 Please.
 No, no.
 Better run, Sister,  'fore the Padre goes boom.
 Seriously, a priest?   You should've seen it.
  Ka-boom!  But you told 'em what to say?  - This is all because of Penguin? - Yeah, boss, but I don't get it.
  You want to take out Penguin, let's take him out.
  This Red Hood stuff is fun,  but it's a lot of work.
  How about you just do what I tell you?  Now, I got you these  so you'll blend in at the party tonight.
  - Huh? Huh? -   Nice suit.
  And that's when we kill him?  No!  No one kills Penguin.
 You should.
  'Cause he's going to murder you.
      Time to have a heart-to-heart, Butch.
  Alone.
  You don't have to buy lunch.
  I know you're a billionaire, but I can buy you a sandwich.
  Do you miss it?  Being a cop?  Sometimes, yeah.
  Gave a sense of mission.
  True.
  There's more to life than having a mission.
  Look, I'll keep asking around about Ivy, but, uh  you want my advice,  talk to Selina.
  Tell her how you feel.
  Does that actually work?  Sometimes.
  It's definitely better than being silent.
  Before you know it, the moment passes.
  And are you taking your own advice?  Afraid that ship has sailed.
  I'm not talking about Dr.
 Thompkins,  I'm talking about the woman you're seeing now.
  Excuse me?  There was lipstick on a coffee mug on your table.
  You've become quite the detective.
    So, are you?   It's complicated.
  - So is Selina.
 - That I believe.
  I just wish sometimes  I had a sign.
  Unfortunately, life doesn't usually work that way.
 We're hours away  from Mayor Cobblepot's victory celebration.
  But people are asking, will the Red Hood Gang  put a damper on the festivities?  Sounds like Penguin's having a bad day.
  I'm supposed to go to his party tonight.
  Part of my re-engagement with being a Wayne.
  Mm.
  Well, give the mayor my best.
  Witnesses say the Red Hoods blamed Cobblepot for their ac  Someone is testing me, Ed.
  They're thinking, Oh, he's mayor now.
  He has to play by different rules.
  No, they'll see,  when I'm roasting their entrails over a fire.
  Perhaps I'm thinking about this all wrong.
  Perhaps this is not about you at all.
  What if this is about the statue?  Of course it's about me!  Yes, you're probably right.
 Oh, dear.
    - Wonderful.
 - Oswald.
  Take a breath.
    What are you doing?  It's an old trick I learned in the lab.
  Most solvents have as their base  I am the son of water,  but if water touches me, I die.
  - What am I? - Again with the riddles.
  Salt.
 Most people think of it as a food additive,  but potassium salt is found in detergents,  - soaps - What is your point, Ed?  I know where the Red Hoods are.
 I say we give him to Penguin.
 Knowing Penguin will gut him like a fish.
  Ladies, come on.
  - After all we've been through - It's his life for yours.
  Simple.
 I don't get it.
  Why'd you turn on him now?  I wasn't gonna hurt Penguin.
  Honest.
  I was gonna take down the Red Hoods myself.
  Tonight.
 At the party.
  All this so you could play the hero?  Ever since Nygma got out of Arkham,  Penguin treats me like I'm nothing.
  That pencil-neck's trying to push me out.
  Let me ask you, we figured out you're the man  behind the Red Hoods, how long do you think it'll take  Penguin and his lap dog?  It's your life, baby.
  You make the call.
  Let me see this through.
  I get my place beside Penguin back,  I'll protect you.
  Oh, you'll do more than that.
  You'll owe me.
  And one day, I'm gonna collect.
    Gilzean.
  Butch, where are you?  The Red Hood Gang is at a detergent factory  in the Narrows.
 We're on our way.
  I got to go.
 Get your things.
  We're done.
 I'm breaking up the band.
  I'm serious, go! Get out of Dodge.
  Yeah, well, not for nothing, but you promised us a payday.
  We're not leaving till we get it.
      Well, I guess it was gonna happen sooner or later.
 What?  Sorry, boys.
    I did it, boss.
  I got 'em for you.
    Peace and order have once again been restored  to Gotham.
  The Red Hood Gang is no more.
    My very own man, Butch Gilzean,  risked life and limb to face down the bandits.
    Was your life ever in danger, Butch?  I can honestly say that if I'd have hesitated,  I'd have been a goner.
      All right, people, listen up!  It's happy hour Finish up those reports  and let's call it a day!  Hey, uh Ed.
  Even before you went crazy,  I never liked you.
  Your zipper's down.
  Listen, Butch did us all a favor.
  Red Hoods go bye-bye, case closed.
  Look at the way the bodies fell.
  It's as if they were just standing there, waiting to be killed.
  Butch comes all the way in the room,  but only one man pulled out a gun.
  I guess they weren't threatened.
  By a 300-pound gorilla?  Whose side are you on, anyway, hmm?  No one's losing sleep over a bunch of dead crooks,  least of all me.
  I said wrap it up!  What have we here?    Burning the midnight oil?  I was just finishing up.
  I'm guessing you're here to reprimand me.
  Reprimand you? For what?  Punching Nygma in the jaw.
  I just couldn't help myself.
  First I'm hearing of it.
  Well done, Doctor.
    Actually, I'm here to ask about, uh  Alice Tetch's blood, if you've heard anything.
  As it happens, I just received  the preliminary results back from the lab.
  - Fascinating.
 - What is?  They injected samples into a group of rats.
  After three days, two of the rats  were showing marked increases in strength and stamina.
  Oh? That doesn't sound so bad.
  But the study ended after one of the rats killed all the others.
  I'm guessing that's not normal.
  It chewed through a dozen wire cages  to get at them no.
  Well, why would one of the rats go psycho  and not the others?  Perhaps the others hadn't had a chance  to show any symptoms, or they were immune.
  Some people live with a disease for years  without having any adverse effects.
  The lab is starting a new study now.
  Well, keep me informed.
  Oh, and, uh don't stay too late.
  I'm sure that fiancÃ© of yours  would like to see you once in a while.
  And was the captain of the GCPD invited  to our new mayor's victory party?  You know, I lost my invitation.
      I can feel it.
    Walking down the street   Kicking cans   Heard you took down the Red Hood Gang  single-handed.
  So to speak.
  - Very funny.
 - Don't forget,  you owe me.
  Summing up the people   Checking out the race   I know.
  Doing what I'm doing   How long do we have to stay?  As long as it takes for you to be seen  in the world, Master Bruce  being Bruce Wayne.
  And smiling.
  So this is our life now?  Fake smiles and mingling.
  I miss the old days.
  -  Feeling like a woman  - So do I.
  Looking like a man   - So nice.
 - Oh, excuse me.
  Yes.
  Bruce, Mr.
 Pennyworth,  I'm so pleased you made it.
  Yeah, well, you know, we're trying to  get out a bit more, Mr.
 Mayor.
  Oswald, please.
  We never got the chance to thank you  for saving our lives from the ex-mayor.
  That was nothing.
 Not at all.
  I find it very fortuitous you turned up when you did  with that bazooka.
  I just felt a bit sorry for Stan, the gardener,  'cause he was picking up bits of Galavan for weeks.
    And now here you are, the new mayor.
  Sometimes life has a way of working out.
  Yes, that's true.
  What is it, Master Bruce?  A sign.
  Please excuse me.
      Right, well, I'll just go and wet my beak.
  Congratulations again, Mr.
 Mayor.
  Hi-Hi-Hi-Hi-Hi   High noon and I'm onto you   I've got my plans and they're bleeding through   Nothing you can say to me   - Hey! - Hey yourself.
  Funny, I never realized how short you were.
  Who the hell are you?  Not yet.
 This is too fun.
  Run along, little kitty.
  Go steal some more wallets.
  Hey.
  So sweet.
  There he is, the man of the hour.
  I have a surprise for you, Butch.
  Not in the mood.
  What's in the box?  Open it.
  Thanks.
  - I already got one.
 - Oh, of course you do.
  And you certainly wouldn't need this one,  as it's so similar to your very own pocket square.
  This is from the Red Hood crime scene.
  It turns out that your suit  and the Red Hood suits were all made  by the same tailor, Mr.
 Fuji.
  That's some coincidence.
  I thought so myself.
  Which is why I called Mr.
 Fuji, and he said  that a large man with a metal hand  Not many of those running around  Bought all six of the suits,  which means, ta-da, you're the architect of the Red  I should snap your neck right now.
    You haven't heard my offer.
  We kill Penguin together.
    What are you talking about?  - You're his guy.
 - Oh, please.
 You fell for that act?  Yes, he broke me out of Arkham  Very appreciative  But I was not cut out to be number two.
  I've simply been waiting for my moment,  which you have graciously provided.
  How would you like to run Gotham with me?    The two of us working together?  You have proven yourself far more cunning than I imagined.
  Now, I assume this little drama of yours  was meant to climax tonight.
  So put on the hood, kill Penguin  I'll help you escape.
  Tomorrow we divide up the city.
  You'd really turn on him,  after all he did for you?  In a heartbeat.
  No.
  Okay.
  Then I guess it's time for surprise number two.
  - You got to Zsasz? - I got to Zsasz.
  And he got to Tabitha.
 Penguin's history.
  The question is, are you?  Can I see your invitation?   What are you doing here?  - I was invited.
 - Of course you were.
  You recognize her?  Should I?  I don't know.
  Hey, are you, you  - I'm me.
 - Uh-huh.
  Well, I'm working, so  Actually, there was something I wanted to tell you.
  Could we go somewhere more private?  Comes around   Fine, but make it quick.
  I can't believe you'd turn on Oswald, too.
  Uh, hello.
 Pot, kettle, black.
  No, it's not the same thing.
 You  Never mind.
  I swear, your goons hurt Tabitha,  so help me  Just do your job.
  -  - Oh  showtime.
  Put on in the mayor  before I put one in Tabitha.
  Ladies, gentlemen,  welcome to The Sirens.
  Tonight we're here to celebrate  the Honorable Mayor Cobblepot.
  Our savior from the monsters,  and the captain of our fair city.
  And now, the mayor would like to say a few words.
    Ed, where've you been?  I've been looking for you all evening.
  Oh, just tying up loose ends.
  I just wanted to say  good luck.
  Okay.
 Thank you.
    Thank you.
  Hmm.
  Tonight is a celebration, not of my victory,  but of Gotham's.
  This is a new day!    -  -     I wouldn't celebrate yet, Mr.
 Mayor.
  Red Hoods ain't finished yet.
  Ed!  - What are you doing?! - Wait!  Sorry, boss.
  Butch?!    - Huh? - Oops.
        The mayor  our mayor vowed that all  of the Red Hoods would be destroyed.
  And now we have the real leader caught  red handed.
      You really thought I'd give you real bullets?  You are an idiot!    I will kill you for this!  Sounds like we're missing all the fun.
  Got plenty of fun left for you.
  You know, if you're gonna take a girl hostage in her own place,  you might want to search it first.
      After all that I've done for you!  - I gave you a job! - I gave you everything!  I used to be somebody in this town,  then you and that sniveling little son of a      Shut up!    I am shocked  and grieved  that one of my dearest friends has betrayed me.
 Yeah!  Upsy-daisy.
      - Oh, my God.
 -     Showtime.
    - Oswald, move.
 -   I am gonna enjoy this.
    Best party ever.
  -  -   Wait.
  - Not now.
 Ed!    Ed!  Ed!  - Ed! -   - Oh! -   So, what's up?  I hired Jim Gordon to help me locate Ivy.
  And?  There was a redhead that had her sweater,  but it wasn't Ivy.
  Saying it out loud, I realize, doesn't sound that impressive.
  No, it doesn't.
  That's really why you brought me up here?    You are the real Bruce  'cause nobody else would be this boring.
  - Great work, detective.
 - That's not all.
  We've been friends a long time, Selina.
  And ever since you've known me,  I've been dedicated to one thing,  but that's done.
  I don't know what's next, but I know  Would you, please just say what you mean?  I like you  as more than a friend.
  It would be nice if you said something back.
  How many girls have you dated?  - What do you mean? -   It's not a trick question.
  How many girls have you dated?  - None.
 - None.
 Hmm.
  Have you ever thought that maybe  you only like me because  I'm literally the only girl you know?  That's not true.
 I feel something.
  And I know you do, too.
 We're the same.
  In what universe are we the same?  - The money doesn't matter.
 - Try not having it.
  It matters.
  There's something between us.
  I know there is.
  You have to see that.
  Rule one.
  Don't ever tell me  what I have to do.
  So, you do have feelings for me?  - I'm confused.
 - Good.
  Come on, just tell me.
  I got all dressed up.
 I even put on lipstick.
  I could lose my job.
  What are you offering?  Fine, then I'll say something.
  If I'm right, you just nod.
  You ran tests on Alice Tetch's blood.
  You found something in her blood.
  A virus, or infection or something.
  Do I have to go over the rules again?  Let's have new rules, sweetie.
  I'll tell you what we're doing with Alice Tetch's blood  and in return  you  Okay.
  Excuse me?  What are you doing?    Two whiskeys and a pineapple juice for this guy.
 What's going on?  - To go.
 - What's going on?  I think you were just leaving.
  Forget this.
  Trust me.
 I'm gonna try.
    What are you doing here?  Just walking by.
  Saw you through the window.
  - Took it as a sign.
 - Like hell.
  You tracked me here.
  And for the record,  I could've gotten what I wanted  from that creep without compromising my honor.
  I know  but you don't have to.
  I'll tell you what you want to know.
  I thought you wanted to keep the woman and the reporter separate.
  - Is that an option? - No.
  Well, then.
  You are gonna have to buy me dinner, though.
  What's good here?    It's ginger tea with honey.
  It's my mother's remedy for a sore throat.
  You sure you don't need a doctor?  No, I'm fine.
    I still don't understand  why you didn't tell me what you were doing.
  Your shock when seeing Butch had to be genuine.
  The people had to believe it  and they did.
  And once again, you're the city's hero.
    But you were almost killed.
  And you saved me again.
      I hope you know, Oswald  I would do anything for you.
  You can always count on me.
  Thank you.
  Need a hand, kitten?  I got it.
        Hold on, Butch.
    Sir, the ambulance carrying Butch Gilzean was just hijacked.
  Damn it!  Put out a BOLO.
  I'll call the mayor.
  Oh, yes.
 M-M-Mister, please.
 Shh.
  My dear, sweet sister.
  Just look  at what he did to you.
  He took you from me!  We belonged together!    And he killed you.
  But, mister, I-I'm not dead.
  If only that were true.
    Those who hurt you  will feel my pain  when my sweet and terrible vengeance  upon them rains.
     

                



                


                    			- Previously on Gotham - I hope you know, Oswald,  you can always count on me.
  Thank you.
  Miss Kringle.
  Dinner.
 Chez Moi.
  Okay.
  That's for Kristen.
 Whatever happened with Tetch?  Broke his sister out of GCPD.
  I'll never go with you!  - I love you.
 She died, he escaped.
  'Cause I heard a rumor there's  something strange about her blood.
  I'll tell you what you want to know.
  You are gonna have to buy me dinner, though.
  He killed you.
    Those who hurt you  will feel my pain.
  -  -   I love you, Daddy.
  I love you, too, baby.
  - I'm so proud of you.
 -   Bye.
    Well, the good part is about to happen.
  I hope so.
  Look at that.
  There's no greater symbol of love  than two people who've made the choice  to spend the rest of their lives together.
  Hey, pal, we have a reception to get to.
  - So, what you say we get a move on? - Oh, yes,  about that I'm afraid you won't be able to attend.
  This some kind of a joke?  No.
  It's quite serious, in fact.
    You're needed elsewhere.
  Let's get out of here.
  - Hey, open the damn door.
 - Sorry,  we mustn't be late.
  Please just don't hurt us.
  That's not my decision to make.
  Your fate depends entirely  on James Gordon.
  Hey.
 Hey!  Don't forget to buckle up.
     What a beautiful morning.
  Sun is shining, birds are singing.
    They say that fortune favors the brave.
  They have that saying in your country, Olga?  Ya ne ponimayu.
  I don't know what you're saying.
  Vash zavtrak gotov.
  It's not important.
  What is important  is that I have found someone.
  What good is love if it's one-sided?  I have no choice  but to confess my feelings to Ed.
  Da.
  Now that, I understand.
  It means yes.
  My mother taught me that.
  She used to tell me,  Life only gives you one true love, Oswald.
  When you find it, run to it.
  So that is what I'm going to do.
  I'm also going to enroll you in an ESL program.
  You really should learn the language  if you're gonna work here.
  So, I hear that Lee Thompkins is running point  on Alice Tetch's blood at the GCPD.
  That would make sense.
  Can you get me a sit-down with her?    Oh, I see.
 You're willing to help me,  just not when it comes to your ex.
  It's complicated.
  Actually, it's really simple.
  You just pick up the phone, you dial her number  and you let her know that Valerie Vale would like  a sit-down to discuss Alice Tetch's blood.
  See? It's pretty simple.
  She won't give you anything.
  You leave that part to me.
  You know, I can get used to this  You helping me with my stories.
  We make a pretty good team.
  Hmm.
 Does that mean you'll share your breakfast?  Absolutely not.
  But really, when are you gonna give up this P.
I.
 act?  So far you've had two cases One girl died,  and the other one, well, you never found her.
  In baseball we call that an O-fer.
  - I'm happy.
 - Of course you are.
  You get to drink scotch all day and have sex with me.
  Uh  I got to go to work.
  You know what?  This is nice.
  Let me know when you hear from Thompkins.
  Uh-huh.
  Can I help you?  James Gordon,  Jervis Tetch has a message for you.
  Follow my friend where to go,  to learn the truth you've hidden below.
  Should you choose not to play,  precious people will die today.
      - This is Gordon.
 - Hello, James.
  Jervis.
  Never should have left that hole you were hiding in.
  Oh, I wasn't just hiding.
  I put the time to good use.
  Made a thorough study of you.
  Quite the fascinating history, yet so tragic.
  A father lost,  career gone by the wayside,  failed relationships.
  And here I didn't think about your once.
    Oh, James.
  I've been inside that head of yours, James.
  I've seen  the web of lies you tell yourself.
  Strung together to keep that  fragile psyche of yours intact.
  Well, it's been nice catching up with you.
  I'm going to force you to confront who you really are.
  And I'm going to drive you mad  doing it.
 Now, please,  direct your eyes to the overpass.
  Meet Dave and Amy Walters.
  Married just this morning.
  Lovely ceremony.
  In 30 seconds they're going to jump to their deaths.
  Take the stairs and you can save them.
 However,  down the street there's a little boy.
  His name is Shane, and he's going to be  hit by a truck, driven by my highly esteemed associate.
    Choice is yours James.
  You can't save both.
 You can't save both.
 You can't save both.
    You son of a bitch.
  Good, now I have your attention.
  They were innocent, Jervis.
 You didn't have to kill them.
  It was your choice, James.
  You practically pushed them off the ledge.
  - Stay with me, James.
 James? - What?  87 Fulton Street, apartment 4C.
 Five minutes.
  No police or more people die.
    Oh, boy, now it's official.
  Why, you looking to back out?  You'd have to put a bullet in me.
  Good thing I don't carry a gun.
    My father called.
   He wants to throw us an engagement party.
  - Told him we're not interested.
 - Okay.
  I know you had reservations about moving back here.
  And you know my dad Half measures aren't his thing.
  If we say yes,  he's gonna put us on display for the whole city.
  I understand.
  But we chose to build a life here.
  And I'm glad.
  An engagement party sounds wonderful.
  These go directly to the city clerk's office.
  And this  Leave this outside  Nicky the Nail's place.
 Knock twice.
  - Light it and then run.
 -   - Okay.
 -   Good morning, Mayor Cobblepot.
  Good morning to you, my chief of staff.
  Here are your schedules for the day.
 This covers your duties  as mayor, and this as kingpin of the underworld.
  You really are settling into your role here, aren't you, Ed?  And yet I still have so much to learn from you.
  Oh    I came up empty tracking down Butch.
  Somehow  that one-handed ape managed to disappear.
  I suspect he's hiding with his old crew.
  I'm sorry for letting you down.
  You have done nothing of the sort.
  I would be lost without you.
  In fact, um  there is something that I need to tell you.
  Something very important.
  What is it, Oswald?  You know what? I forget.
   In and out of my head, just like that.
  Don't you hate that when that happens?  That never happens to me.
  You know what? I believe that.
   So, uh, where are we off to first?  PS 134.
 You're touring a school.
  Press will be there, so we better get a move on.
  Great.
 I love children.
    Okay, thank you very much.
 Okay?    Hey, Cap, I just spoke to that kid over there.
  You're not gonna believe this.
  He said Jim Gordon saved his life.
  Pulled him out of the way of a truck.
  Get him on the phone now.
  I already tried him.
 No answer.
    What happened, you forget your cane?  I don't need it anymore.
  Put an all-points out on Gordon.
  I want him found.
  Hey, does that guy look strange to you?  I mean, more so than the usual whack job?  Hey, pal!  You see what happened here?  I have a message for you.
  James Gordon, I have a message for you.
  James Gordon, I have a message for you.
  - He's hypnotized.
 - James Gordon,  - I have a message for you.
 - Tetch.
 Cutting it close, James.
  Like what you've done with the place.
  Everyone needs a hobby.
  Take a peek through the lens.
  Let's chat face-to-face.
  I wonder, what is it that you have against married couples?  Bad memories, perhaps.
  Understandable, given the last time  you saw a woman in a wedding dress,  she had a shotgun pointed at you.
  - Hey, Jervis.
 - Yes, James?    - Hello? - Don't you ever do that again!  Okay.
    This is about your sister, isn't it?  In your addled brain, you blame me for what happened to her.
  Don't you talk about her!  I got to know her, Jervis.
 She was a good person.
  That's why she hated you.
  Why she died trying to get away from you.
  You want revenge, kill yourself.
  Dismissive, rude.
 I don't like your attitude.
  Well, tell you what.
  I'll come down, and we can talk about it in person.
  Hang up again, she dies.
  - What are you talking about? Who? - Surprising, really,  given that every relationship you've been in  ended in such misery.
  And yet, you made the choice to date again.
  Poor girl.
 She had  no idea who she was getting into bed with.
  She will soon.
  See for yourself.
  Great thing about reporters.
  Tell them you have a story,  and they'll meet you anywhere.
      Got him in a safe house uptown.
  You would not believe the amount of steak that man eats.
  Poor, Butchie.
 Nothing but Tabitha and red meat all day.
  You know, sooner or later,  Penguin is gonna figure out who sprung him.
  You need a plan, sweetie.
  - I'm working on it.
 - And in the meantime,  has the flame rekindled between you two,  or are you still holding out?  - We'll see.
 -   Oh, speaking of old flames.
 Oh.
  Well, you just can't seem to stay away.
  - Tetch where is he? - How should I know?  And if you don't mind, Tabitha and I are just in the mid  -  - Unnecessary.
  Jervis Tetch kidnapped Valerie Vale this morning.
  He knew things that only you could have told him.
  I want to know where he is.
  Oh.
 See that fire?  I mean, where was that when we were together?  All I got was Captain Vanilla.
    Seriously, we have to open in a few hours.
  - Then talk.
 - Firstly,  I don't know where Tetch is.
  Secondly, he may have come in here  a few days ago asking about you.
  - Asking what? - Oh, you know,  everything.
  Family stuff, GCPD, the women in your life.
  He seemed especially interested in that.
  He knew all about Vale already, but I told him  about us.
  About how you're still in love with me,  cry yourself to sleep at night.
  And Lee?  Did you tell him about her?  Oh, you mean  Miss Rebound from me? Of course.
    We'll send you a bill for the damage.
  Lee, listen to me.
 I'm sorry, James.
  Lee can't come to the phone right now.
  Can I take a message?  No? Good.
  Gotham Water and Power, ten minutes.
  I need to know she's okay, both Lee and Vale.
  What you want means nothing to me!  - Nine minutes.
 -   James sends his regards.
  Now, where were we?  Oh, yes, introductions.
  Lee Thompkins, meet Valerie Vale.
  You both have one very important thing in common.
  You're two halves of Jim Gordon's heart.
  James Gordon, I have a message for you.
  Where is Jervis Tetch?  James Gordon,  - I have a message for you.
 - Yeah, I know.
  You said that the first hundred times I asked you.
  James Gordon, I have a message for you.
  Where is he?! I know you can hear me!      Hey, Cap, a uni just spotted Gordon  pulling up to Gotham Water and Power.
  Tell him to hold his position till we get there.
            Glad you could make it, James.
  Where's Lee and Vale?  Oh, you clearly have no sense for stagecraft.
  We must build to the climax.
  This is merely the second act,  where we stoke the tension.
  On the right is one of Gotham's finest pediatricians.
    On the left, Channel Five's favorite anchor.
    A doctor and a journalist.
  - You get it? - Yeah, I get it.
  The choice is simple, you see.
 It's kill  one, and the other will go free.
  But if your answer to me is no,  a thousand watts into them will go.
      Sorry, Jervis.
 I'm not killing anyone.
  Yes, you will!  Now pick up the pistol and fire!  You want to show me who I really am, then show me.
  Oh, I will.
  I'm done playing your game.
 Jim!  Hold.
  What the hell's going on here?  Captain Barnes, you're just  in time to see James kill these two innocent men.
  You need to find the main power shutoff now.
  - Go.
 Even when  you don't choose, James, there are consequences.
 No!    No.
 No!  - I'm gonna find you.
 - Oh, I'm counting on it.
  Just ask an old friend how to get to the end.
  -  - This is our third grade class.
  How many more grades do we have to visit?  This is a K through 12 building.
  - Twelve? - Mm-hmm.
  We don't have to see every single class, do we?  Mayor James used to read to the children.
  Aubrey James is illiterate, ma'am.
  - It's well documented.
 - Perhaps we should move on.
  What's wrong with that boy there?  That's Luke.
  He's new here.
  Hello, Luke.
  I am Mayor Cobblepot.
  Why aren't you playing with the other children?  What if they don't like me?  Well, how would you ever know if you don't give it a try?  And if they don't like you,  wait for them to turn their backs  and push them down the stairs.
      Little guy needed a push.
 That's all.
  I continue to be in awe of you, Oswald.
  Ed.
  There is something I would like to discuss  in a more private setting.
00?  I'll pick us up a nice bottle of wine.
 Tetch has  Lee Thompkins and Valerie Vale.
  - You're sure? - Saw him take Vale.
  And I called Lee's cell and he answered.
 So, yeah,  pretty sure.
 Call the M.
E.
's office,  call her fiancé Find her.
  What the hell is going on here?  Tetch blames me for what happened to his sister.
  - He wants revenge.
 - So, what,  he kills two innocent civilians.
  - How does that track? - He's obsessed  with showing me who I really am,  driving me insane.
  He killed them, and I just stood there.
  What were you supposed to do,  shoot one of 'em? You did what you could.
  That's on him.
  This is just to prepare me.
  He's gonna make me choose.
  He's gonna put me in front of Lee and Vale,  and he's gonna make me choose.
  - And if I don't - He'll kill both of them.
  We're gonna find her.
  I promise you that.
  Listen to me, Tetch is a lunatic.
  He's gonna get caught.
  The most you can hope for is a lifetime in prison.
  - Don't do this.
 - Dumfree,  let's see what's in the kitchen.
  Mm-hmm.
    Nice try.
  So why'd they bring us back to your place?  Like I know.
  Well, any chance your boyfriend might come home?  Not likely.
    You do know what this is about, don't you?  Yes.
 Tetch blames Jim for his sister, and we're his means for revenge.
  - I've been here before.
 - That's too big.
  It's never gonna spring the mechanism.
  You know, it is kind of ironic though.
  I was just asking Jim to get me a sit-down with you, and  - here we are.
 - Uh-huh.
  See, I'm running a story on Alice Tetch's blood.
  I know you're running point for the GCPD.
  You're not seriously trying to interview me right now, are you?  Jim said you wouldn't talk to me.
  And he was right.
  I think he was just being protective of you.
  Anyway, about Alice Tetch,  I hear they're running experiments on her blood  at the GCPD bio facility.
  - Care to comment? - Maybe you're just really sacred  and this is your way of coping,  or maybe you're just insanely committed to your job.
  Either way, all I'm interested in is getting out of here.
  Try a cuticle pusher.
  My dad was a cop Taught me how to pick locks.
  I can walk you through it.
  Thank you.
  And in exchange, you can talk to me about Alice Tetch.
  You and Jim are made for each other.
  Thanks.
  It's not a compliment.
  Thank you, Dr.
 Calvi.
 I'll call you as soon as we hear anything.
  Mario's been in surgery all morning.
  Says that he and Lee left the house together this morning.
  She was headed to the station.
 He hasn't heard from her since.
  Jervis must have grabbed her before she got here.
  What's his next move?  Tetch wants me to find him.
  Well, if that's the case, then why didn't he just tell you  - where he is? - I don't know.
  But the last thing he said was something about an old friend  leading me to him.
  Well, I'm not just gonna sit here and wait  for Tetch to send you an invitation.
  Listen up!  Jervis Tetch thinks that Gotham is his personal playground.
  He's taken innocent lives.
  And now he has Lee Thompkins and Valerie Vale.
  And to whoever puts the collar on Tetch,  my personal gratitude and best bottle of brown.
  Now go to work.
 Follow my friend where to go.
  James Gordon, I have a message for you.
  James Gordon,  - I have a message for you.
 - Hey.
  James Gordon.
  - I have a message for you.
 - How do I get to the end?  The true test will be revealed.
  A final decision you must yield.
  Our tea party begins once more  when you walk through Lee Thompkins' door.
  - Jim.
 - Not now.
  What the hell is going on? Where's Lee?  Look, you're just gonna have to trust me.
  Trust you? According to Captain Barnes,  you're the reason she's in trouble to begin with.
  You know something.
  You know where she is, don't you?   Keep your voice down.
  Does Barnes know?  - Where is he? - No, he does not know.
  Because if he showed up with 20 cops, both Lee and Vale would be dead.
  I see.
 So you're gonna go in all alone and save 'em?  Is that it?  Actually, you might be the only person who could help me.
  Come on.
  - Remember, you have to feel - I got it.
  Can I ask you something?  As long as it's not about Alice Tetch's blood.
  Why'd you move back to Gotham?  The way I hear it,  you made a pretty nice life for yourself down south.
  It's really none of your business.
  Maybe not.
  But you could have moved to any city, gotten any job,  yet you chose Gotham  and the GCPD.
  You realize that we both might die today, right?  Mm-hmm.
  Well?  I didn't come here for James Gordon,  if that's what you're worried about.
  -  - Not bad.
    - My turn.
 - Okay.
  - Okay, so what's our plan? - You're gonna break free,  we're gonna lure in one of these goons,  hit him over the head with something.
  Not good.
  Um, you can still get out of here.
  I'm not leaving you here.
 There's got to be something else  - we can use.
 My, my.
  You two have been busy.
  Now, if you'd kindly join me in the dining room,  the guest of honor will be here shortly.
      Welcome to our tea party, James.
  We've been expecting you.
  Please.
  Have a seat.
  - I think I'll stand.
 - You'll do what I say  or things will get messy.
  And by messy I mean  my two friends will pull their triggers,  and then we'll have blood and brains  all over this beautiful table.
  So  place your gun on the platter and have a seat.
  Really?  After all we've been through today,  you have to think about it?  Not everyone here has to die.
  It's gonna be okay.
  Don't lie to them, James.
  Lee,  would you mind passing that down to James?  I must apologize  for the hideous china.
   Frankly, I expected more from Don Falcone's son.
  I guess I know what I'm getting you for your wedding.
    To good health.
  I think I'll pass.
  Me, too.
  You know what,  I'll have some.
  Bravo, James.
  Now,  I'd like to begin by telling the story  of a brother and a sister,  separated for years but whose love never waned.
  Fair warning though,  it has a sad ending.
    But I couldn't find my sister alone,  so I turned to this man, James Gordon,  whom everyone said was a good man,  an honorable man.
  And what did this good man do?  Why,  he found my sister and he turned her against me,  poisoning her mind.
 And then he killed her!  Does that sound about right, James?  - Sure, why not? - Now, James,  I get the sense you're not being honest.
  Though that's not surprising, considering  you've run from your true self every day of your life.
  But you can't run from this choice.
  The woman you love is going to die.
  I just need to figure out which one it is.
  So let's review our options, shall we?  On the one hand, we have Lee Thompkins.
  Intelligent, kind.
  She thought she could save you  from your darkness, drag you into the light.
  And what did she get for her efforts?  Hmm?  Pain and sadness.
 Don't listen to him, Lee.
  Look in her eyes.
  She still has love for you, James.
  And then,  there's Valerie Vale.
  The intrepid reporter  from a blue-collar family.
  She still has hope for you.
  What will happen when she learns who you really are?  So  those are the choices.
  Now it's up to you.
  Which lady  has your heart?  Who do you love?  You want me to choose?  Tell these idiots to lower their guns.
  I don't trust them not to shoot me by accident.
  You're right.
 They are stupid.
  Down, boys.
  Now you drop your gun.
  - And why would I do that? - Because I'll shoot you.
  Well, well.
 This was your grand plan, James?  Play along until Dr.
 Calvi could sneak in  and shoot me dead?  Well, there's only one small problem.
  Before you arrived, I went down to the basement,  and switched the magazine  in that gun with an empty one.
    My apologies, Dr.
 Calvi.
  I only set the table for four.
  Dumfree, will you please escort the doctor to the bathroom?  I believe there's still one chain in working order.
  Now  I'm out of patience.
 You want to talk about love, fine.
  Let's talk about who you love,  - or loved.
 - Don't.
  Your sister knew you were crazy, Jervis.
  Stop it.
  She was terrified of you.
 She hated you.
  - Enough.
 - She told me  what you did to her when you were kids.
  The thought of you disgusted her.
  Lies! Deceit!  The story you tell is incomplete.
  She loved me.
 She loved you?  She killed herself rather than be with you.
  She didn't no.
  She impaled herself on a spike and died in agony  because even that was better than having you touch her.
  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
  I saw her when she was dying.
  Her face  when she knew she was finally safe from you,  she was smiling.
  Because despite the pain, she was happy.
  Liar!  She was the only thing I ever loved,  and you, you  sent her soul to heaven above.
  Yes.
  That's right me.
  I'm the one you want.
  So let Lee and Vale go.
  Keep me but let them go.
 Oh, James.
    You're trying to confuse me.
  But I won't let you.
  No.
 I'm determined  that you'll live on and suffer  without your love as I have.
  Choose.
  No.
 I won't choose.
  You will.
  You will.
  You'll certainly spill.
  I'll make it easy for you.
  On the count of three,  instead of telling me who you love,  tell me who to kill.
  Or I shoot them both of them,  which would be such a thrill.
  One.
    Two.
    Three.
  Kill Lee.
    Oh, finally.
  The truth is revealed.
  You chose Lee because you love Vale.
  - Very well.
 I knew you had it in you, James.
  All this time, you made everyone believe  you were the hero,  but deep down you always knew the truth.
  You're a villain.
    Vale.
  This is Dr.
 Leslie Thompkins.
  Please send an ambulance to 25 Blackstone Drive.
  Hurry!  Move.
  You're gonna be okay, Vale.
 You hear me?  You're gonna be okay.
 Hold on.
  Victim's name is Valerie Vale.
  Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
  BP's 100/60.
  Tachy's at 160.
  O.
R.
 One's prepped and ready to go.
  Clear the way.
  Clear the way, please.
  I've got her from here.
    Ed.
  A man comes to a crossroads in his life,  and he has to make a choice.
  Does he choose safety and cowardice  or does he opt for courage and risk everything?  I choose courage.
  What I'm trying to say is   The thing I've been wanting to tell you all day long is  I love you.
    Impossible to pick the perfect bottle, isn't it?  Well, it all depends on region and vintage.
  Of course, you have to consider the wine pairing.
  Miss Kringle?  No.
 Oh, no.
 My name's Isabella.
  Um, I'm sorry to bother you; I don't usually talk to people.
  There's just, um, something about you.
  No, no, please.
 There's  There's no need to apologize.
  You ju  You remind me of someone that I used to know.
  A long time ago.
  You struggle to regain me.
  When I'm lost  you struggle to obtain me.
  What am I?  Time.
  I'm Edward.
  Edward Nygma.
    Jim.
  - How is she? - Still in surgery.
  She seems like a tough cookie; she'll be all right.
  What about Tetch?  We got the whole department canvassing the city.
  We'll find him.
  Why didn't you come to me?  I couldn't.
  And I thought I could save them both.
  You did what you thought was right.
  Maybe.
  In the end, I did exactly what he wanted.
  He won.
  We'll see.
  (indistinct announcement over P.
A.
)  Mario's a great doctor.
  She'll pull through.
  - Lee, about what I said - Jim.
  Not now.
     

                



                


                    			1 Previously on Gotham  You are a cop in everything but name.
  Saving Gotham's not my job anymore.
 If a person comes into contact  with my blood, it changes them.
  It affects every person differently.
 I won! They really want me as mayor.
  How did you know I would win?  I believe in you, Oswald.
  Even when you don't believe in yourself.
  Miss Kringle?  No, my name's Isabella.
 You remind me of someone.
  I'm Edward.
  Nygma.
 The past is the past.
 I know that we can't change the past,  but there's a difference between moving on and letting go.
  Who do you love?  Or I shoot both them,  which would be such a thrill.
  Kill Lee.
 I'm so sorry this happened.
  Stop the press.
  Tough guy Jim Gordon  sheds tear for Valerie Vale.
  How you feeling?  Like a bullet went through my insides.
  You don't have any whiskey, do you?  - Sorry.
 - You get a girl shot  and you don't even bring her booze.
  You got a lot of nerve.
  I never meant for you to get hurt.
  You did.
  You wanted to save Lee.
  I wanted to save you both.
  Yeah, but you could only save one of us.
  That's why you told Tetch  to kill Lee because you knew he would do the opposite.
  Oldest trick in the book.
  At least tell me you caught him.
  He's still in the wind.
 Listen.
  - Vale, it's not what you think.
 - It is.
  You love Lee.
  Which means we're done.
  - If there's anything I can do - No.
  No, Tetch was right.
  You're nothing but trouble.
 So  let me get this straight.
  You're about to be in possession of some kind of  virus?  Yes.
  It's blood-based and can be a little unpredictable.
  It can take weeks for symptoms to manifest.
    Oh!  - This -   is an accelerant.
  Mix it with the blood  - wham bam -   That virus'll hit 'em like a semi  going 90.
     The Red Queen.
  She's a blend of psychotropic plants.
  Ah, thought she'd be a big hit.
  Turns out, she's only good  at putting people in the loony bin.
  - I'll take her! - Ah-ah-ah, b-b  That stuff's no joke.
  At first, it incapacitates you.
 Then  an hour into the trip   it completely fries your brain.
  Perfect.
  I'm looking to sideline someone  before this evening's event.
   That'll do it.
 This city tore my love from me,  so I'm plunging it into insanity.
 And that's where I discovered my love of books.
    I never thought a fractured tibia  would launch my library career.
  But it did.
  The tibia is the second-largest bone in the body.
  Second only to the femur.
  You have exquisite femurs.
 Morning!  The morning paper.
00.
   Uh, Edward  These past 12 hours have been the best of my life.
  When can we meet again?  What can't you have for breakfast or lunch?  Dinner.
 I'd love to.
  Delightful.
00.
 I understand that one is expected  to wait 24 hours before filing a missing persons report,  but, sir, I am the mayor.
  - Oswald.
 -   I am so sorry.
    When you didn't come home,  I assumed the worst.
   I am so glad you're okay.
  I'm better than okay.
  I met someone.
  I think I'm in love.
 Hey! Hey, you can't be down here.
  Oh, I disagree.
  I don't understand why we're doing all this, boss.
  Wasn't plugging Gordon's girlfriend enough?  Jim Gordon wasn't the only one responsible  for my sister's death.
  Gotham ripped Alice from my loving arms  and turned her against me.
  What better way  to make this city pay  than by spreading my dear, dead sister's legacy?  Oh, Alice  Well.
 It's quite the operation  you've got going on in here, isn't it, Master Bruce?  Do you need a hand?  I got it.
  Right.
  What time can we expect Ms.
00, I think.
  We'll see, won't we?  She's coming, Alfred.
  And, uh, Alfred  Yes, yes.
 I know, uh  I'll make myself scarce,  I'll give you all the privacy that you need.
  Within earshot.
  And the lights on.
  Well, I got bad news and worse.
  Skip the preamble.
  It was definitely Tetch and his two dum-dums.
  And? What about Alice's body?  The eggheads here have had her body on ice since it arrived.
  Her blood's frozen, but still viable.
  The second Tetch heats it up  He has himself the virus.
  How the hell did he even get in here?  The old-fashioned way.
  Somebody let him in.
 I got an unconscious lab tech  and a missing guard.
  My money's on the guard.
  Shouldn't you be in the hospital with Vale?  She's fine.
 Give me the rundown.
  Oh, so I take it you're rejoining the force?  I just want to help.
  There's no reason I need to be a cop to do that.
  Well, as long as I'm captain of the GCPD you do.
  I'm tired of giving you slack.
  Get the hell off my crime scene  before I throw you ass in lockup.
  Biehl, Alban,  escort Mr.
 Gordon off of the premises.
  If he resists, book him for obstruction.
  I'll go on my own.
  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
 Uh-uh!  No.
 I see that look in your eye.
  Do not try to solve this by yourself.
  Then help me.
 If Tetch has Alice's blood,  we don't have much time.
  No, I'm not gonna aid you on one of your solo,  bullcrap, kamikaze missions anymore!  Tetch murdered four people yesterday.
  He shot Vale I can't just let him get away with it.
  Nobody's asking you to.
 But Barnes is right.
  Either be a cop, or don't.
  What are you so afraid of?  Is that what you think?  That I'm afraid?  You know, you should go to the hospital.
  Be with Vale.
  And let those of us who want to wear the badge  do our damn jobs.
  You are going to cut quite the fine figure  at the Founders' dinner tonight.
  Yes.
 Did you know that this dinner  has been thrown annually for over 200 years?  It was started by the first families of Gotham.
  Only the most powerful citizens are invited.
  It's a shame I don't have a plus one.
  I can't go anyway.
 I have a date.
  With the woman you claim to be in love with  after only knowing for a few hours?  The heart keeps its own time.
  I'm partial to the purple.
  The brocade brings out my eyes.
  Are you sure you aren't mistaking infatuation for love?  You did say she is the spitting image of Kringle.
  Isabella's beautiful.
  And smart.
  So she bears a passing resemblance to Kristin.
  It's just the universe telling me  Telling me I have a second chance at love.
  Where did you say she works?  The Main Public Library.
  You're right about the brocade.
  Do you mind if I skedaddle?  I just need to pick up a few things for tonight.
  Who am I to stand in the way of love?  The missing guard from the lab, he called in sick.
  My gut says he's lying.
  Well, he's certainly no candidate for sainthood.
  Gambling, petty theft  -  - Might I have a word, Captain?  Bring him in.
  What is it?  I just heard from the head of virology  at the Biomedical facility.
  Is this about the tests they're running on Alice Tetch's blood?  Yes, in the first trial  One of the rats ran off the rails and murdered the rest, I know.
  Doc Thompkins told me.
  But she thought it might have been an anomaly.
  I'm afraid the second study proves otherwise.
  As in the first study, the rats showed  increased strength and agility, but  by week two  the rats were exhibiting manic tendencies.
  Violent rage.
  By the study's end, every trace of their  original demeanor had vanished.
  I assume they're, uh, working on a cure.
  Yes, but it could take years.
  And we only have hours.
  Damn it!  If this virus gets set free  We have to find Tetch, now.
  Yes, sir.
 Watch closely, Dumfree.
  Isn't science marvelous?  Gravity, a few heaters  and voilÃÂ !  The last drops of coagulated blood  become cocktail mix.
 Ah!  Bravo, Alice.
  Truly your best work.
  - You're kidding me? - Please, calm down.
  - He said, Kill Lee? - He knew Tetch wouldn't.
  How?  How could he possibly have known that?  Somehow he got inside Tetch's head.
  And he knew that he would do the opposite of what he told him to.
  I see.
 So, why would Gordon offer up  the woman he's dating in place of my fiancÃ©e?  Mario, stop it.
  We have so much to be thankful for.
  I just want to move past this.
  Fine.
  But Jim Gordon's the reason  you were in danger to begin with.
  I want him out of our lives.
  Of course.
  I came by to bring this to Vale.
    I got to get back to the ER.
  He's angry.
  I get that.
  He has every reason to be.
  I figured you'd be out chasing down Tetch.
  Barnes banned me.
  No badge.
 No investigation.
  That's never stopped you before.
  They closed ranks.
  Even Bullock.
  He says I'm refusing the badge because I'm afraid.
  Jim I know what you did  last night.
  When you told Tetch to kill me, you knew he would shoot Vale.
  No, I'm sorry.
 That's not true.
  At least have the decency to be honest with me.
  I am being honest.
  I wanted to save Vale.
  Bullock was right.
  You are afraid.
    Hello, there.
   Mr.
 Mayor, what an honor.
  How can I help you?  I am attending the Founders' dinner this evening  and I wanted to brush up on the history  of Gotham's first families.
  My chief of staff suggested I come here.
  I think you might know him.
  Yes.
 I know Edward.
  We just met,  but  well, I feel I've known him my whole life.
    How romantic.
  Oh, listen to me, blathering on.
  You wanted a book.
  Um  Oh.
  I'm  so glad you appreciate Ed.
    Really, I should thank you for brightening Ed's spirits.
  He has been so down since he got out of Arkham.
  Edward was in Arkham?  You don't know?  It was front page news.
  I stick to books.
  Don't people typically go to Arkham for murder?  I make it a policy not to gossip  about staff, but        Uncanny how much you look like her.
  It's that swan-like neck.
  -  - Ed loves a neck.
      Well, thank you for the book.
  It was a pleasure meeting you.
    Hey.
 The tea party was part one.
  I want to have a lot more fun.
 I had my way with you.
  Now Gotham's up for round two.
  The hell are you talking about?  Why, I'm going to dismantle your beloved city,  from the top on down.
  And you can't stop me.
  Enjoy the trip.
  It's going to be a bumpy ride.
 There you are.
 So good to see you.
 Likewise.
 Come on, let's get some wine.
    Watch where you're going.
  Of course, Mr.
 Mayor.
  So sorry.
  Cretin.
    Jim.
  Jim.
  Jim!  Finally, sleeping beauty stirs.
  Where am I?  You got dosed, buttercup.
  Welcome to your hallucination.
  - What are you doing in it? - Hell if I know.
  Now, we've got a lot to be getting on with.
  I don't have time for this.
    See, that's the thing about hallucinations, Jimbo.
  You got to ride out the trip.
  Bummer, huh?  What exactly does this trip entail?  Well, no one gave me an itinerary,  but knowing what goes on inside your head,  I'm sure it'll be chock-full of belly laughs.
    Just kidding.
  We all know fun isn't your forte.
    This is where I face my inner demons, huh?  That's up to you.
  Well, go on.
  Unless you want to stay in this tiny space with me.
  I'll take my chances.
 Jim.
  Jim.
  Jim.
  Jim.
  Bruce?  You don't have much time.
 You don't have much time.
 Bruce.
  Bruce!  Where did Bruce go?        What?    Never leave your unit behind.
    I have to find him.
    Bruce.
 Bruce!  I'm glad you came.
  What did you mean when you said I didn't have much time?  I just wanted you to follow me  -  - so I could show you that.
    Down there.
    It's because of you.
 Congratulations, Jim.
  You did it.
  You're the hero you always dreamed of being.
  Bruce  Don't      Your name was on the schedule.
  Yeah, I told you.
 It was my shift at the bio lab, but I  - came down with something.
 - The only thing you're coming down  with, pal, is ten years at Blackgate.
 Hey, hey, hey.
  That's no way to treat a sick man.
  Listen, Sullivan,  Tetch got in using an employee's key card.
  Just show us your card, and you're free to go.
  Screw you.
  I want a lawyer.
    -  -   You pigs think you're such tough guys    Honest citizens driven mad,  tearing each other limb from limb  just because you decided that this city's security  is not your concern!  Tell us what you know about Jervis Tetch!  Tell us what you know about Jervis Tetch!  - Captain! Cap.
 - Aah  Cap! Hey.
  I thought I was supposed to be the bad cop here.
  A bruiser in a wrestling mask  paid me to hand over my key card and take the day off.
  Promised I wouldn't get in trouble.
  Said the cops would be too busy taking back control of the city.
  And?  Tell us something that might actually help.
  He was driving a catering van.
  Why would the Tweeds need a catering van?  Wait.
  What's the date?  Friday.
  The date.
  The 27th.
  The Founders' dinner.
  The archbishop, the comptroller, the mayor,  all in the same place.
  Put together a unit.
  And not a word to Gordon.
    A drop of blood  in each wine glass  makes madmen  of the ruling class.
      What the hell are you doing?  Saving your life.
 Like you wanted.
  The last thing I want is your lips on my mouth.
   News flash.
  Everything that is happening  is in your head.
  Which means you made me give you CPR.
  Just like you put me  in this really cheesy nurse's uniform.
  That's easily rectified.
   Seriously?  One bad encounter with Bruce, and  I don't want to talk about it.
  Fine.
 Just don't fall into a monosyllabic depression  because   We're at the next stop.
  I have mixed feelings about this floor.
  I'm afraid to ask.
      It's more than I could bear   To find that I'm forsaken   If you're a fantasy   I'm so glad you're home.
  Mom thought you were gonna be late.
  Ha! Mom owes me a quarter.
  Mom!   We made a bet that you were gonna be late.
  Frankie had more faith than I did.
  Now go on.
  Take those rolls to the table.
  How was your trip?  Earth to Jim.
    Sorry.
 You just look so beautiful.
  Ew! You guys are gross.
  Julie, one day, you're gonna love somebody  as much as I love your father.
  - Never.
 Boys are dumb.
 - Are not.
    You feeling okay, honey?  Just glad to be here.
  With you guys.
  I love you so much.
    Does that mean we can get a dog?  You two.
 You're the best, Dad.
  I'm so afraid   That you may vanish   In the air   The best!  So, darling   If our romance   Would break up   - Just the best, Jim.
 - No  No, no, no! No! No! Come back!  You look like you need a drink.
      Jim    Open the damn gate, Barbara.
  I need to get back to them.
 To her.
  If you're so desperate to have Thompkins and the two kids,  why are you in that crappy apartment playing private dick?  Let go of me.
 You don't know what the hell  you're talking about.
 I know you're lost.
  You want to find your way home?  Play nice.
  It's a long way to the basement.
    So  The little minx was a no-show.
  Well, it seems a frightful shame to let  this beautiful meal go to waste.
  What say we wrap it up and have it for lunch tomorrow?  Hey?  You always bring your butler along on dates?  Right.
  I'll leave you to it.
  Excuse me, miss.
  You're late.
  Stuff came up.
  Geez.
 Chill.
    - Alfred really outdid himself.
 - I made all of it.
  For you.
  What's with the attitude?  You stood me up.
  I got busy.
  Selina, if we're gonna do this,  whatever this is,  I need you to be honest with me.
  This?  Me and you.
  It's weird for me.
  Okay?  It's weird for me.
  It's weird for me, too.
  So  are you gonna cut the cake, or what?      Of course, I didn't want to stand in the way of love, but  this woman would have been a disaster.
  It sounds as if you did your friend a favor.
   I'm sorry, I have been talking so much.
  I never asked your name.
  Kathryn.
  Just Kathryn.
  - Mm-hmm.
 -   How did you end up at the Founders' dinner?  If it's not rude of me to ask.
  Not at all.
  I'm from one of Gotham's oldest families.
  And I'm part of a group which  oversees things.
  What sort of things?  Everything that matters in Gotham.
  We've had our eye on you for some time,  Mr.
 Cobblepot.
  - Who exactly are you? -   We'll contact you when the time is right.
  Enjoy your evening.
    Excuse me,  did you notice the rather  severe-looking woman I was speaking with?  She said her name    - What is this? What is going on? -   I'm afraid your evening has been hijacked,  Mr.
 Mayor.
  I see the champagne didn't leave a mark.
  - I'm so glad.
 -   For those of you who don't know me,  my name is Jervis Tetch.
  I promise not to take up too much of your time.
  But the fact is, you  are the heads of Gotham.
  And tonight  the heads of Gotham will roll.
  But first  a toast.
  A drink to your health.
  And if we don't?  Change, my friends, is nigh.
  Drink the wine  -  - or else you die.
 Oh!  She's in you, isn't she?   What fun!   What fun!    Shut up!  Shut up!    Last stop.
  Don't be scared.
  It's not easy to face who you really are.
  I should know.
  Do you ever wish you were the person you used to be?  Do you?  Use this.
  Or don't.
  It's up to you.
  Good luck, Jim.
  Sir  Sir, I think you're looking for this?  Dad?  Hey!  It's good to see you, son.
  I'm always losing that darn thing.
  Get in.
 We don't want to be late.
 Doctor? Doctor?  Some help.
  Doctor, he's unconscious.
  Dr.
 Calvi, he's in here.
  Jim?  Jim.
 This was beside him.
  Red Queen.
  I've heard of this.
  Get me 20cc's of Haloperidol.
  - Right away, Doctor.
 - Jim, can you hear me?  -  - Jim.
  Jim!  Come on, Jimmy,  it's time to go.
  Something wrong?  No.
  I'm just glad to see you.
  I missed you a lot.
  Yeah, sorry I haven't been around more.
  Heard you got into some kind of trouble.
  You want to talk about it?  When I was a kid,  people would tell me, Your dad's a hero.
  All I knew is you went to court every day,  and every night you came home  and you played ball with me while Mom made dinner.
  Then I got older  and I understood you were a hero.
  Only for me, it wasn't just that you'd been a great D.
A.
  It was that you got up day after day,  you faced down the worst the city had to offer,  but you never brought that home to Mom and me.
  You protected us.
  I wanted to be just like you.
  Turns out I'm the opposite.
  I destroy everything and everyone around me.
 Come on, Jimmy,  I'm far from perfect.
  I got plenty of darkness inside me,  I just don't dwell on it.
  Focus on the good you can do.
 That's what counts.
  - That's what I'm trying to do.
 - No.
  Been hiding behind self-righteous  lone wolf nonsense because you're afraid.
  Why is that?  The badge holds expectations.
  People want a hero.
 And I'm not.
  You know what makes a hero, son?  A man who values protecting others  above protecting himself.
  A man who knows his limits but isn't afraid to fail.
  A man who knows when to ask for help when he needs it.
  Now  I-I wasn't always that man,  but damn, that didn't stop me from trying.
  - I don't know how to be that man.
 - Well, sure you do.
  Just got to follow the code.
  What you remember what that is?  No.
  The code we Gordons promise to live by?  No.
 Why can't I remember?  Because you're lost, son.
  If you want to find your way back home,  the answer you're looking for is in my ring.
  Ah shoot.
  It's time for me to go.
  No.
 I want to talk to you more.
  No, I can't.
 Someone's coming for me.
  No, Dad.
  No, Dad, please.
 Don't go.
 No, Dad!   I'm proud of you, Jimmy.
  Dad!  Jim?  Jim, can you hear me? Jim.
  Yeah.
  Yeah, I can hear you.
      It's Haloperidol,  an antipsychotic.
  You were dosed with a pretty powerful hallucinogen.
  - It was Tetch.
 - I know.
  Someone saw him leaving the hospital.
  You know, you're lucky.
  Another minute, we would have lost you.
  Thank you.
  It's my job.
 Dr.
 Calvi?  We need your signature, please.
  Uh-huh.
  I'll get somebody to take the I.
V.
 out.
  Half an hour, a glass of orange juice,  you'll be good to go.
  So while I did  kill my girlfriend,  who does look rather similar to you,  it was not out of malice or intent.
  It was an accident that I deeply regret.
  And I was not gonna tell you this, but then  Edward,  I know what you did.
  You do?  I spent the afternoon reading every article about you.
  You know what I did and yet  you still came on this date anyway?  Well  That's not logical.
  Love isn't logical.
  I've lived my whole life inside the pages of books.
  Anthony, Cleopatra,  Romeo and Juliet,  Othello and Desdemona.
  All of whom died.
  Edward,  you're the first to measure up.
  You're the one I waited for.
  You're not scared of me?  Of course I am.
 Well, Ed,  you would not believe the night  Oswald, good evening.
  This is Isabella.
    Oh  we have met.
  -  - Mm.
  Would you excuse me?  I am very tired.
    Dum spiramus tuebimur.
  While we breathe,  we shall defend.
    - Come in.
 -   You busy?  Just finishing up some paperwork on Tetch.
  He and the Tweeds are safe and sound in Arkham.
  Hopefully, that's the last we'll hear from them.
  Congratulations.
  You did what I couldn't.
 I mean that.
  A humble Jim Gordon.
  What do you know?  I hear Tetch sent you on quite a trip.
  If it wasn't for Mario, I'd be dead.
  Anyway, I'm not here about that.
  I want to rejoin the GCPD.
  Why the sudden change of heart?  I made a promise to someone when I was younger.
  I intend to keep that promise.
  Good.
  We need you here.
  I need you here.
  Welcome back, Detective.
 It seems you left dinner  just in time.
  Indeed.
  And what did you think of our new mayor?  My gut says once a criminal, always a criminal.
  We'll keep an eye on him.
  Judgment is coming, Kathryn.
  For all of us.
     

                



                


                    			- Previously on Gotham - On the count of three,  instead of telling me who you love,  - tell me who to kill.
 - Kill Lee.
 You chose Lee because you love Vale.
 If a person comes into contact with my blood,  it changes them.
  Listen to me! I would never do anything to hurt you.
  Kristen.
  No!  You wanted to save Lee.
  You knew he would do the opposite.
  You love Lee, which means we're done.
  I have found someone.
 I have no choice  - but to confess my feelings to Ed.
 - Da.
  Is this about the test they're running on Alice Tetch's blood?  Yes.
 The rats were exhibiting manic tendencies  - Violent rage.
 - I assume they're, uh,  working on a cure.
  Yes, but it could take years.
  Nobody move!  -  - What is going on?  I'm afraid your evening has been hijacked.
 Glasses down! -   - Is that my dear sister I see? -   She's in you, isn't she?  - Miss Kringle? - No, my name's Isabella.
  You remind me of someone that I used to know.
  I met someone.
  I think I'm in love.
   I want to rejoin the GCPD.
  Welcome back, Detective.
    GCPD! Hands in the air!  Back away, slowly.
  This ain't what it looks like.
  Explain it to me down at the precinct.
  For now, you'd be wise to keep your mouth shu  Listen, uh, can we talk about this?  Be reasonable, man.
    Look, I didn't kill anybody, okay?  I'm the cleaner, that's it.
  You're just the cleaner.
  Yeah.
  You're just the guy who chops up the bodies  and dumps them in a vat of acid.
  That's it.
  What are you doing, man?  Just take me in, okay?  Oh, I'll bet that's what you want.
  For me to read you your rights,  make sure you get a lawyer.
  Two, three years from now, I see you on some corner,  free as a bird.
  Any other night, yeah.
  It would eat at me, but, yeah, I'd do it.
  Not tonight.
  The Toad.
  He-he's the one you want.
 He gave me the job.
  See, something's gotten into me.
  When I see a scumbag like you,  my blood starts boiling in my veins.
  I just want to punish you, make you suffer.
  Up until now, I've been able to control it.
    But it's getting stronger inside of me.
  Please.
  The Toad, I told you.
  He's the one.
  Just arrest me.
  Arrest me!  We're past that.
  - Please!  -    Morning.
 We knew what we were getting into, right?  When we agreed to let my dad throw us an engagement party?    Oh, we knew.
  I mean, who are these people?  He's very proud of you.
  And he wants all of Gotham to know that.
  Well, he succeeded, 'cause he invited most of the city.
    How are you so okay with this?  Because I agree with him.
  He should be proud.
 As am I.
  How did I get so lucky?  What is it?  James Gordon is returning to the GCPD.
  - When? - He starts today.
  Um how long have you known this?  A few days.
  I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner.
  It's fine.
  Is it?  I don't know, Lee.
  We agreed he wouldn't be part of our lives.
  A-And now you're gonna be working with him?  That's a part of our lives.
  Do you trust me?  Because if you do,  then nothing else matters.
  Of course I trust you.
  And you're right, you're right,  it's all gonna be okay.
 It's just  when I think about what happened with Tetch,  a-and the things that Gordon said, I  So, don't think about it.
  I'll try.
  But if you accidentally shot him  I'd be okay with that, too.
  No promises.
  See you tonight.
  Yeah.
    Lock this bum up.
    Hey, hey, hey!  There you are.
  We got a call.
 Warehouse district.
 You coming?  That's it? No welcome back?  Please.
 If we had a big to-do every time you came back  to the GCPD, we'd never catch any bad guys.
  Ándale, partner.
  Oh, and, uh,  I believe this  belongs to you.
  You coming or what?  Yeah, I'm coming.
  What must be broken before it can be used?  Eggs.
  Correct! As always.
    Oh, Edward, you spoil me.
  You make it easy.
  I'm gonna miss you.
  I'm only gone two days.
45 on Monday.
30 into Gotham.
  If you leave on time today,  which I'm sure that you will Mm-hmm.
  You'll be gone for 44 and one half hours.
  Less than two days.
    I will hold on to that thought.
  Cream! I forgot your cream.
  Mmm, mmm, mmm.
  So what does one do at a librarian's conference?  It would bore you.
  Nothing that you would say, do or think could bore me.
  In that case, let me read you my schedule.
  Ooh!      Where did those glasses come from?  These?  These are my backup pair.
 I normally wear contacts.
  I thought you knew that.
  Something wrong?  Edward, what is it?  You look like you've seen a ghost.
  Excuse me.
      It's just a pair of glasses.
 I remember you loved that style on me.
     Oh, dear.
    I haven't upset you, have I, Ed?    I would've thought you would've been used to  seeing people in mirrors.
  You're just in my head.
  Like that makes a difference.
  But honestly, besides the fact that she looks just like me,  you went from someone who files papers in a police station  to someone who files books in a library.
  Not super original.
  You and Isabella are  you're somewhat different.
  Well, I'm dead.
   And she's alive.
  But how long will that last?  Until you  I    I would never hurt Isabella.
  Bet you would've said the same thing about me.
  Face it, Ed.
  You're a killer.
  It's only a matter of time before    Okay, so, a uni I.
D.
'd the vic.
  One Paulie Penopolus, aka Paulie Pennies.
  Cleanup guy for the Gotham underworld.
  Bingo.
 I'm thinking it was some kind of business deal.
  Maybe an unhappy customer.
  Perhaps a competitor.
  Good place to start.
  Hey, listen, seriously, Jim  I'm glad you're back.
  Me too, Harv.
  Feels good.
      This wasn't just business.
  We should call Barnes.
  You know why I'm here.
  Oh, yes.
  Yes, indeed.
  She's in there, isn't she?  Inside of you.
  Hello, sister dear.
    Just tell me.
  You grew up with your sister.
  You've seen this virus firsthand.
  How do I beat it?  Hmm.
  I believe  the way this works is  you give me something, I give you something.
 Ticktock.
  How's about I let you keep your teeth?!  Or  my sister's virus  is a beautiful thing.
  It makes the darkest parts of a person sing.
  What darkness in you  has Alice brought to life?  Tell me that,  and I'll tell you everything I know.
  Criminals.
  The guilty.
  My anger at them.
  Oh, but it's not anger I see.
  Rage.
  Violent, bloody  rage.
  All right, Tetch, my turn.
  Is there a cure?    Yes.
  There is a cure.
  What is it?  You give in,  and let my dear sister win!   You think I'm playing?!  Have you heard the voices?  What voices?  The virus, even as it grows stronger, waxes and wanes.
  You may have the illusion  you're winning.
  Then you hear the voices.
  Those dark voices from deep within you,  whispering whispering    and finally,  you'll see the world as it really is.
  Then there will be no more Captain Barnes,  only Alice.
    - My dear Alice.
 -   You don't know me!  You've dirtied your hands, haven't you?  And now you're desperately trying to make it right.
  I can make it right.
      You're back.
  I'm back.
  I suppose it was only a matter of time.
  Once a cop, always a cop.
  For better or worse, this is where I belong.
  - How's Vale? - Good.
 I think.
  She's out of the hospital, anyway.
  - You two are not? - No.
  I'm not trying to make this awkward.
  Why would it be? We're both adults.
  There's no reason we can't work together.
  I'm glad you feel that way.
  Mario agrees?  He will.
 Eventually.
  Right.
  Our engagement party is tonight.
  I only bring it up because a few people here are going.
  Now it's awkward, isn't it?  A little.
  You want to know about the two bodies  that, uh, were found this morning.
  Yes.
  I've only done the preliminary examination,  but the John Doe in the acid, his face had been removed.
  Removed? How?  Scalpel? Razor blade?  Whoever did it knew exactly what they were doing.
  I'll have more for you soon.
  Jim.
  I think you made the right decision coming back.
 in the bathtub, also might have killed him  - to tie up some loose ends.
 -   Uh-huh.
  Jim.
 Good to see you with a shield again.
  And a tie.
  Captain, good to be back.
  Bullock was just filling me in.
  Hell of one to catch on your first day.
  Yeah.
  That's the preliminary report from Lee.
  John Doe had his face removed.
  - Trying to cover up his identity? - Yeah, maybe.
  But the acid would have done that anyway.
  I'm running point on this one.
  - That's cool.
 - Honestly, Cap  Look, I know I've been away  Maybe that's why  you've forgotten how things go around here.
  I give you an order and you follow it.
  Which, for the record, Captain, I totally support.
  I'm taking point on this, not giving you the day off.
  Follow the physical evidence, Bullock.
  Report back to me.
  Aye, aye.
  Jim.
  I didn't mean to bite your head off.
  It's just, sometimes the ugliness here gets to me.
  No need to explain.
  Let me know if you need anything.
  And, uh  don't let the bastards haze you too hard, rookie.
  Yes, sir.
  Gordon.
  Here's the one you wanted, Captain.
  Uh, mid-level felon, goes by The Toad.
  Yeah, that's him.
 Thank you.
 Maybe she's right.
  What if there's something about Miss Kringle's  Kristen's Isabella's face?  What if there's something about her face that  unlocks this side of me?  What if I do hurt her?  Oswald.
  - Yes? - You're smiling.
  - I was? - Yes.
  Oh.
  Well, I was just thinking  how darned lucky Isabella is.
  You love her, yet to protect her,  you are willing to break up with her.
  Beautiful.
  Sad, but beautiful.
  So you think I should break up with her?  I'm sorry, I thought that's what we were talking about.
  Certainly, I would never pressure  No, you're right.
  If I did hurt her, I would never forgive myself.
    That life would put her in your path again,  only to snatch her from you.
 Why?  I can't do it.
  - What? - I can't break up with her.
  But you said yourself  I need you to do it for me.
  Would you do that?  I would be forever in your debt.
  Just be gentle.
  Of course.
  I'm looking for a punk who supposedly  frequents this rat hole.
  Goes by The Toad.
 Who's askin'?  Captain Nathaniel Barnes of the GCPD.
  How about you and I go down to the precinct,  and you can answer some questions?  Blow, pig.
    I want to know about Paulie Pennies!  The body he was getting rid of last night  Where did it come from?!  Maybe you want me to open that mouth for you.
  Okay, stop.
  I-I hired Paulie.
  But I'm just a go-between.
  I'm so sick of hearing that.
  No one's responsible for anything.
  Everyone's a middleman.
  I want a name!  Symon, okay? Dr.
 Symon.
  He's a big-time plastic surgeon.
  So what, he likes cutting people's faces off for kicks?  - Try again! - No.
  He's got a side business.
  You get in trouble, you need a new face,  he gives you one.
  A new face?  - Whose? - I don't know.
  I just get rid of the bodies, that's all.
    You think  you're not guilty,  but you are.
  Stop, okay, stop!  It's Symon!  He's the one you want.
  You're a cop.
    Symon, huh?  Take me to him.
  Mayor Cobblepot?  Hello, Isabella.
 May I?  Um, of course.
  Going somewhere?  Just for a couple nights.
  But I was hoping to talk to Ed before I left.
  Um, tried calling him.
 Is he okay?  Hmm.
 Yes.
  How shall I put this?  It's over.
  Excuse me?  He is not going to see you anymore.
  Do not try to contact him.
  That door is closed.
  Have a nice life.
    Oh, my.
   It is a shock.
  But besides your  odd resemblance to his ex  a certain facility with riddles  compulsion for order  what is it that you two really have in common?  Edward is a person of exceptional intelligence  and imagination.
  He deserves to be appreciated by someone on his own level.
  And you,  my dear, are simply not.
  Best to end things now.
  You're right.
  I don't deserve him.
  Glad we agree.
  Bye.
  But I'm not gonna let him go.
  He loves me.
  And I love him.
  Do you know how rare that is, Mr.
 Mayor?  Of course you do.
  Because you love him, too.
  I can see it.
   I'm not even jealous.
  I-I don't think that you understand  It was my glasses this morning.
  They reminded him of Miss Kringle.
  He's afraid he's going to hurt me like he hurt her.
  Listen to me, you little idiot,  I am telling you one last time,  - let Ed go.
 - No.
  I will write to him.
  I will make him understand he has nothing to fear.
  I'm not gonna let him go.
    Very well.
  Don't say I didn't warn you.
        You better not have been lying to me.
  I'm not.
 This is his place.
  You're not gonna kill me, are you?  I'm trying.
  I'm about to take the face.
  Be here in an hour, and we can do the transplant.
    You haven't eaten today, have you?  Very good.
  I have to thank you, my dear,  for taking such care of your skin.
  Excellent elasticity.
  Now hold still.
      Who's there?!    Quiet.
 Or we'll forgo any anesthesia.
  I said, who's there?  GCPD.
  You're under arrest.
  Go for it.
  Please.
    I surrender.
  Ma'am, you all right?    How many?  Excuse me?  How many have you killed?!  How many faces have you taken?  I have the right to an attorney.
  I wish to invoke  that right now.
 Guilty.
Guilty.
  Who's there?! Guilty.
 Guilty.
 Guilty.
  No one.
 It's only me.
 Guilty.
 He's guilty! Guilty.
  - Guilty.
 Guilty.
 Guilty.
 - What is wrong with you?  - He's guilty.
 Guilty.
 -     What are you doing?  Arrest me.
 Guilty.
 Guilty.
 Guilty.
  - I'm not resisting! - Guilty!  Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!  Guilty.
 He's guilty.
  Guilty.
 The point Dr.
 Thompkins hopes you pay  particular attention to is the level of strength required  to sever Paulie Pennie head from his torso.
  And what level would that be, Lucius?  Extreme.
  Extreme strength.
 Got it.
  As for the other victim in the bathtub, we haven't gotten any hits  on his prints, but a puncture mark in his arm suggests  he was drugged prior to having his face removed.
  I'll run toxicology, I'll let you know what I come up with.
  Thanks, Lucius.
  Yep.
  It's good to have you back, Gordon.
  Lucius, you're in forensics, not the M.
E.
  Is there a reason Lee didn't bring this herself?  Dr.
 Thompkins has already gone for the day.
  Her engagement party.
  Right.
  I hear it's gonna be quite the affair.
  Beautiful women,  free booze, canapés.
  - Harvey, you can go if you want.
 - Oh, no.
  I'd much rather spend time here with my old partner.
  Much more fun.
  Besides,  I wasn't invited.
 Bullock, book this piece of human garbage  for the murder of John Doe.
  You got it, Captain.
 Come on.
  Plastic surgeon.
  Face man for the underworld.
  He had a girl on the table.
  If I had been there five minutes later  But you weren't.
  You did it, Captain.
  Yeah.
  Today.
  You know that feeling, Jim, when you've won the battle  but you know you're gonna lose the war?  Wars are fought one battle at a time, sir.
  You said he killed the John Doe?  - Not Paulie Pennies? - No.
  His killer's still out there.
  I'll get him tomorrow.
  Promise.
    My father and I haven't always seen eye to eye.
    But I think, Dad, you'll agree that  marrying Lee is the best decision I've ever made.
  - Without a doubt.
 -   And Lee.
  You're a doctor, a member of our city's  police department.
  You're funny, compassionate and brilliant.
  Despite insisting all dogs are boys  and all cats are girls   it's hopeless, I've tried to correct her  I've loved you since the moment I saw you.
      So wonderful.
 Lee.
  Congrats.
  You look gorgeous.
 No surprise.
  - Barbara.
 How did you - Get in?  As a plus one.
 With that guy there.
  Hey.
  Or it might have been him.
  You need to leave, right now.
  Can't we bury the hatchet?  So I came at you with a knife, kidnapped you, whatever.
  I've forgiven you for beating me unconscious.
  Water under the bridge.
  You just stay right here, I'm gonna get someone.
  I'm leaving.
  Just wanted to ask.
  As someone else who was once with Jim Gordon,  don't you miss it?  Miss what?  The heat.
  Being so close to so much darkness and light,  to someone always at war with himself.
  Let me think Tormented Jim Gordon,  or Mario, who I know is a good man,  who'll be a wonderful father to my children,  and whom I love.
  No.
 I don't miss it.
  Wow.
  I think you actually believe that.
   It's kind of sad.
  Tell my dates I've left, would you?  Uh-uh.
  - Don't let her ruin your night.
 -   Captain.
 I'm so glad you came.
  I-I can't stay.
  I came to congratulate you.
  You deserve to be happy.
  Thank you.
  But you have to stay for at least one drink.
  If nothing else,  to save me from these people.
  One drink.
  - But no work talk.
 - Deal.
  So, among the materials confiscated in Symon's lab,  I came across a unique anesthetic cocktail.
  Let me guess.
  The same cocktail toxicology found in the John Doe.
  Exactly.
  Hey.
 I got some bad news.
  - Symon walked.
 - What?  The girl he had tied up refused to press charges.
  They probably paid her off.
  And we just got an order from Judge Bam-Bam  demanding his immediate release.
  The Botox son of a bitch is uber-connected.
  The toxicology definitely ties Symon to the John Doe murder.
  We got to get him back here.
  Captain Barnes?  Carmine Falcone.
  I don't believe we've met.
  No.
  But I was just leaving.
  I see.
  Is my company so odious?  You belong behind bars.
  I'm retired.
  After running Gotham's underworld for 30 years.
  This city was built because of men like me.
  People have jobs because of men like me.
  That whiskey you're drinking?  Paid for through my work.
  So you did some good.
 So what?  Doesn't mean you're above the law.
  Nobody is.
  You know, whenever I hear a man  possessed of such certainty,  I always think he's trying mostly to convince himself.
  I wish you a pleasant evening, Captain.
 Hey, Captain.
  Alvarez.
  Tell Gordon I'm bringing him the man responsible  for Paulie Pennies' murder.
  No backup.
  He's coming in of his own accord.
  Sure thing, Captain.
  But you should know, the judge released Dr.
 Symon.
 Guilty.
  Guilty.
 Guilty.
 Guilty.
  Guilty.
 Guilty.
  Guilty!  Guilty.
 Guilty.
 Guilty.
  Guilty! Guilty.
  Guilty.
    Isabella.
  Isabella, I got your note.
  I thought you needed to leave for your conference.
 I can be late, Edward.
  This is more important.
  Oswa   Oswald  the mayor, he informed me of your position, um  but believe me, I-I think our breaking up is for the best.
  No, Edward, it's not.
  I understand your fear.
 It comes from a place of love.
  I know you won't hurt me.
  You never could.
  I don't think that you    Oh, my  Kristen.
  I found old photos in newspapers.
  You have to I need to leave now.
  No, no, no, no, no.
  No, no, no, no.
 Look at me.
  Look at me!  You don't know what you're doing.
  I am forcing you to face your fear.
  You won't hurt me, even when I look like this.
  Edward.
 Edward.
 No, no, no, no.
  No, no, no, no, no.
 Edward.
  Should I take the glasses off?  Keep them on.
  Seal off the exits, but do it quietly.
  Last thing anyone wants  - is a scene.
 Yes, sir.
  Little late for that.
  What are you doing here?  I'm sorry, but we have to make an arrest  in the Paulie Pennies case.
 We tried to get  the guy at home, but his housekeeper  said he was here.
 Just makes you realize  what a small town Gotham is, doesn't it?  Couldn't you wait?  If he's here, he's not exactly running.
  She makes a good point, Jim.
  You want to take that one?  Good evening, everyone.
  Jim.
 What's going on?  Apparently, there's a murder suspect among our guests.
  Can I ask who?  Dr.
 Maxwell Symon.
  - He's a - Plastic surgeon.
  You arrest him, you're gonna have to fight off  every woman here.
  He's a favorite.
  He's also a murderer.
  I'd be curious to know how your father knows him.
  I'm sure that their relationship  is completely above board.
  While you two hash this out, I'm gonna go grab Symon.
 Harvey.
 - What? I can handle  a plastic surgeon on my own.
  And don't worry,  discretion is my middle name.
  Lee, I'd like a word with Jim.
  - Mario - It'll be fine.
 Okay.
  Look, Mario, I have a job to do,  so whatever this is  When you told Tetch to kill Lee,  you knew he would do the opposite.
  You sacrificed your girlfriend for my fiancée.
  That's insane.
  Can we just admit you still love her?  - I don't have time for this.
 - Hey.
  You once told me that if I ever hurt Lee,  you'd kill me.
  Well, now it's my turn.
  I love Lee and I'll do  whatever I have to to keep her.
  Then word of advice  lose the jealousy.
  It's weak.
  Gordon.
    For Lee, I'll give you that one.
    Oh, Captain if you keep frowning like that,  you'll never get those wrinkles out around your mouth.
  Come down to my office tomorrow.
  I'll give you a free evaluation.
  I'm surprised you can feel that  through that thing you call a face.
  What are you doing?!  What I should have done all along.
  You're insane.
  Oh, no, Doc.
  I'm saner than I've ever been.
  I'm seeing things clearly  for the very first time.
  All these years, I've put my trust in the system,  my trust in the law, held myself back  from doing what I really wanted to do.
  And then I saw the truth.
  It's not just you that's guilty.
  This whole city is guilty.
  Stop.
    You're a police officer, for God's sake!  You have to follow the law.
  I don't have to do anything.
  I am the law.
  I am judge    jury    and executioner!      Ed.
  - How'd she take it? - What?  Oh.
 Uh, um everything is    wonderful.
  Isabella showed me that, uh  I was worried over nothing.
  I'm so happy for you.
  But why are you back?  Well, she had to go to her conference.
  I insisted.
  You're a good man.
  But you look done in.
  I will hear all about it tomorrow.
  Get some sleep.
  Got to give her credit.
  She fought for him.
  Too bad she underestimated her opponent.
  I'm assuming it's done.
  Yup.
  Feel kind of bad, though, boss.
  I always liked librarians.
  You?  What about poor Ed?  He will be heartbroken.
  Luckily, he has a shoulder to cry on.
        Uh-oh.
 Come on.
 No, no.
  Oh, come on.
 Uh-oh.
  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
  Help me, help me! Somebody, help!  -  - Oh, dear.
    Jim, you and Mario have a heart-to-heart?  - Yeah.
 Where's Symon? - No luck.
  He must have skedaddled.
  I thought he might be at the bar.
  Uh-huh.
 Okay.
  Keep a perimeter in case he shows back up.
  I'm gonna head to his house.
  And, Harvey, uh take it easy, huh?  It's good to have you back again, Jim.
  - Uh-huh.
 - I'm real glad.
  Captain.
  - Did you hear? - Everything.
  I saw Symon here earlier.
  You manage to pick him up?  Not yet.
 He must've skipped out when we showed up.
  We'll get him.
  Alvarez said you were bringing in the guy who did Paulie Pennies.
  Turned out to be a dead end.
  I'll let you know when I find Symon.
  Jim.
  Things are gonna change around here.
  You and I are gonna make a difference in this city.
  We're gonna clean it up.
  Yes, sir.
 Guilty.
 Guilty.
 Guilty.
  - Guilty.
 Guilty.
 -   Guilty!  Guilty! Guilty!  - Guilty.
 -   Guilty.
  Guilty.
Guilty.
  GCPD.
 Sir?  Dr.
 Symon.
  Who did this?  Barnes.
     

                



                


 Ivy's missing.
  She'll turn up somewhere.
  It was a long way down into water.
 What's your name? My name's Ivy.
  - Who the hell are you? - Not yet.
  This is too fun.
 He loves me and I love him.
 I am telling you one last time,  let Ed go.
  - No.
 - Very well.
  Don't say I didn't warn you.
  Oh, no.
 Somebody help!  I want to rejoin the GCPD.
  Welcome back, Detective.
  Captain, I'm so glad you came.
  I came to congratulate you.
 If a person comes into contact with my blood, it changes them.
 You and I are gonna make a difference in this city.
  We're gonna clean it up.
    Sentence served.
  Symon.
   Who did this?  Barnes.
 So, seems anyone could have gotten access  to that bathroom, not just the guests.
  Suspect pool's wide open.
  All right, start with statements  from everyone at the party.
  Someone saw Symon go into that bathroom.
  Okay.
  I still can't believe it.
  I'm sorry things went down this way.
  Don't apologize; you were right.
  Did you give your statement already?  I'm afraid I wasn't very helpful.
  Till about an hour ago, I couldn't pick Symon  out of a crowd.
  Did you talk to Barnes at the party?  A little.
 We had a drink.
30.
  The attack happened just before.
00.
  What is this about?  -  Nothing.
 - Nothing? Really?  I can't talk about it.
  No.
  Lee, I cannot talk about it.
  Jim, I hope you know what you're doing.
  Me, too.
  Barnes? No.
 No, no, no, no, no.
  I asked Symon who attacked him,  and he said Barnes.
  Symon was a psychopath  who gave face transplants to the mob  using stolen faces.
  Hardly a credible witness.
  And this guy, Barnes?  If he so much as jaywalked,  - he would write himself a ticket.
 - I know.
  And now you're saying he went to Lee Thompkin  engagement party, and out of nowhere, busted some guy's face  and chucked him through a wall? - I know, Harvey.
  - What's the motive? - I don't know, maybe he  He saw Symon,  he got pissed he was released,  and he lost control.
  Okay.
 So, you're saying  that a man with a spotless 20-year career,  just went ape.
 Is-is that your theory?  Something's been off about him recently.
  You yourself said he nearly beat Tetch to death.
  And what's with him insisting on running point  - in the Paulie Pennies case? - Look,  I don't know, but that does not make him a killer.
  So where is he now?  Home.
 He spent the better part of yesterday  chasing down Symon, maybe he's tired.
  That doesn't mean he's guilty.
  The last thing I want is for Barnes to be guilty.
  I look up to the man.
  But if there is even a chance then we have to know.
  And something doesn't feel right.
  Okay, okay, okay.
 I'm gonna help you.
  But just so you know, I'm doing it to prove  he's innocent, not guilty.
  That's fine.
 All right, so I'll go back to the scene,  see if forensics can pull some prints from the bathroom.
  Barnes's should already be on file.
  Jim.
 I know how to do my job.
  I hope I'm wrong.
  Yeah.
 Me, too.
        It starts as a whisper.
  You have to strain to hear it.
    And then it grows louder and louder,  till it becomes a roar.
  It's everything you can do to just shut it out.
  And just like that  you suddenly realize it's your voice.
  The one you've been denying.
  Telling you who you are.
  What you have to do.
  And then you stop fighting.
  And this calm comes over you.
      Sex trafficking.
  Drugs.
  Murder.
  I've kept files on all three of you for years.
  Waiting for the proof we needed  while you sneered at the law.
  Not tonight.
  Tonight, I am the law!  And you are hereby tried.
    Found guilty.
  And sentenced.
  Justice is served.
   So what's an antiquities dealer?  I buy and sell rare and beautiful objects.
  I like to think I have an eye for beauty.
  Is this a bug?  An Egyptian scarab.
  More than 3,000 years old.
  It's priceless.
  Everything has a price.
  What's upstairs?  The bedroom.
  Hmm.
  And the vault.
  Vault?  It's where I keep my most valuable acquisitions.
  Can I see?   Ivy,  you are very beautiful.
  But we've only just met.
  We haven't had time to get to know each other.
  Who are you?  Where do you come from?  What do you do?  Well, I'm from Gotham.
  And I meet men.
  Like you.
  They give me things.
   And what do you give them?  Nothing.
  I also like plants.
  I've always been able to get them to grow for me.
  Lately, I've been using them to make perfume.
  Plants are so much more powerful than people imagine.
  They can poison you, heal you,  make you fall in love.
  I made this from a strain of cananga odorata.
  Smell.
 Now, open the vault.
 Access granted.
      Did they send you? You lying schlampe!  Did they?      Come back here!  You hear me? I'll find you!    - Everything okay? - Fine.
  You've been checking your watch all morning.
  - You expecting - A call from Isabella.
  She's at her librarian conference.
  Ah.
  Probably just busy.
  Most likely.
  I can imagine librarian conferences  can be hectic affairs.
  - Not so much.
 - Well,  I'm sure she'll call soon.
      Hello.
  This is Edward Nygma.
  Why?  Very well.
  That was the GCPD.
  They want to see me.
 Wouldn't say why.
  Oh?  You don't think that something happened  No!          The officer said Isabella blew through a red light  and crashed into a train.
  They think she might've fallen asleep at the wheel.
  Yours was the last number in her phone.
  I am so, so sorry, Ed.
  Did she suffer?  No.
  Anything you need, Ed,  anything at all,  I am here for you.
 Still collecting strays?    Lady,  you got two seconds to get out of here  before I gut you like a fish.
  You really don't recognize me?  Selina, it's me.
  Ivy? Hey, you got anything  to eat around here?  I'm starving.
      Yeah.
  Jim, I'm outside the scene.
 Forensics found tons  of prints inside the bathroom where Symon was attacked.
  Barnes?  That just means he was in there.
  - It puts him at the scene.
 Listen,  I've been thinking.
 You got to tell Barnes what Symon said.
  Give him the right to defend himself.
  I will.
  When I'm ready.
    Help you?  Captain.
  I was, uh, looking for the Paulie Pennies file.
  Thinking the cases might be related.
  Thanks.
  Fill me in.
  Nothing hard yet, but we'll get there.
  Uh-huh.
  I was reading through some of the witness statements.
  The couple from the alley They say when they found  Symon, he was still alive.
  You were first on the scene.
  - Did he say anything to you? - No.
  He didn't ID the killer?  No.
  Ah.
 'Cause one of the witnesses seems to think  that you were talking to him.
  He tried, sure.
  But he couldn't speak.
 He died  almost right away.
  Uh-huh.
  Well, for what it's worth, I called  an old C.
I.
 of mine with deep ties to the mob.
  He says that  once I collared Symon, the higher-ups got jumpy.
  You're saying the mob had him killed?  He was giving these guys new faces.
  He's probably the only one who can ID them.
  - That's a lot to protect.
 - Makes sense.
  My C.
I.
 also had a name.
 Mid-level enforcer,  goes by Sugar, works out of the East End.
  - Says he actually did the killing.
 - I'll have a team pick him up.
  I'd rather you kept this between us.
 Mob still has  their fingers in most of these guys' pockets.
  You never know who you can trust.
 So,  you ready to ride with the old man?  Sure.
 Just let me run it by my, uh, partner.
  Why bother him?  We'll be there and back before you know it.
 So where are we headed?  Sugar works out of an old foundry at 133rd and 6th.
  Oh, that reminds me.
  It's Harvey.
 Leave a message.
  I'm with Barnes, heading to 133rd and 6th.
  Get there.
    You never know what's gonna go down.
    I have to say, Jim,  I'm disappointed with you.
  Oh, yeah? How's that?  Lead detective for a high-profile murder,  and you don't collect statements from everyone present?  Me.
    Well, let's do it now.
  And for the record, I waive my right to counsel.
  - Captain - Ask your questions, Gordon.
    Did you see Symon at the party?  Yes.
  - Did you talk to him? - No, I did not.
  Did you see him go into the bathroom before he was attacked?  Unfortunately, no.
  Were you ever in it?  Yes.
  Before it was a crime scene, obviously.
  So, Detective, am I in the clear?  For now.
      This city's a cesspool.
  Don't you ever want to do something about it?  I thought I was.
  What, as a cop?  I would think that you, of all people,  would find that limiting.
  Not anymore.
  Came back to the GCPD to do things right.
  Like you.
  - Like me? - Last year,  at Galavan's, when we were attacked,  you told me the law shows you where the line is.
  That stuck with me.
  Some would say that our job, first and foremost,  is to protect the citizens of this city,  even if it means bending the laws.
  No.
 We break the law, we're no better than the criminals.
    Is that what you were thinking  the night that Galavan was killed?  The first time.
  This city's at a crossroads, Gordon.
  Question is Will good men fight for it?  Will they do what's necessary?  The decision is yours to make.
  You passed our stop.
 133rd and 6th?  Did I say that?  136th and 3rd.
  It's an honest mistake.
  - Mmm.
 I don't believe it.
  - Mmm.
 - Well, I should have known.
  I saw what that freak Marv could do.
  How he could age people, and when  he told me that the girl wearing her sweater was older, I  I should have realized.
 That's really Ivy.
  Trust me.
  She came, and literally ate all my food.
  Immediately ate all my food.
  It's her.
  So why is she back here?  Good question.
  Ow! What was that for?  For being alive and not telling me!  I'm sorry.
    I was just having fun.
  Why did you come back?  I don't have to answer your questions.
  Why'd you call him anyway?  'Cause you freaked me out!  Where have you been, and  why are you dressed like that?  Oh, it's so crazy, Selina.
  When you look like this,  guys just come up to you and give you stuff.
  Half the time, you don't even have to steal it.
  Hmm.
 And what do you give them?  Hmm.
 I have ways of getting what I want.
  - I'll bet.
 - You do look nice.
 So why did you come back?  And don't say it's 'cause you missed me.
  It's true.
  You may be ten feet tall, but you're still a crappy liar, Ivy.
  What's going on?    Well, I might be in trouble.
  - I knew it.
 - There was this guy  - What was his name? - Like I learn their names.
  So I was at his place last night.
  Total creep.
 Anyway, I stole a necklace.
  I was surprised he noticed 'cause he had so much crap.
  But he caught me, and he totally freaked out.
  If only Marv's power had made you smart, too.
  - You steal all the time.
 - Yeah, well,  - I don't get caught.
 - Shh.
  Rude.
  No.
 Be-be quiet.
   I hear something.
    We have to go.
  Someone's here.
   Ivy, in.
  Bruce! Seriously?      So who is this guy again?  Just follow my lead.
  -  - GCPD!  - Don't move! - Hey.
 Whoa.
 Whoa.
  - Hiya, Sugar.
 - What the hell is this?  We're here about the gas bill.
  You're delinquent.
00 p.
m.
?  At your mama's, like always.
  Answer the question.
  I was at the fights.
 A dozen people saw me.
  A dozen of your lying, bottom-feeding friends?  The name Symon mean anything to you?  - No.
 No?  Plastic surgeon? Face man for your mob buddies?  Wait No.
  Like I said, so whatever the hell you think I did, I didn't.
 You know what?  I think he's telling the truth.
  He didn't kill anyone.
  But you're not innocent.
 I think we lost them.
  Is that who you stole the necklace from?  Uh, no.
 I-I don't think so.
  Then who were they?  I don't know.
 Maybe they work for him.
  Oh, great, Ivy! Now my squat is burned,  and masked weirdoes are trying to kill us.
  So glad you came back.
  You have to return it.
  What? No way.
 Ivy, he's right.
  That dumb necklace almost got us killed.
  It's mine.
 I worked for it.
  And it's super valuable.
  - How much? - Wait.
 Bruce, don't.
  If I buy it, you get paid, but we can still return it,  and those men will have no reason to harm us.
  How much?  - One thousand dollars.
 - Fine.
   Idiot.
  - Two thousand.
 - Fine.
  Five No.
 I'll get you $5,000 in cash today.
  Or you can try to avoid those men on your own.
  That's my offer.
    Now, where does this man live?    Now, just raise your chin a mite higher.
    Would you excuse me for a moment?    Ed.
  Yes.
  The music!  It's too loud.
 I'm sorry!    Isabella always loved Vivaldi.
  So you are just going to sit here.
  - Yes.
 - All by yourself.
  Correct.
  Okay then.
   Apologies.
  Ed, I, as much as anyone,  know how hard it is to lose someone.
  -  - Even if  you've only known them for, like a week.
  But this is not healthy behavior.
  It is depressing  and, if I'm being honest,  a bit scary.
  Less scary.
  Check.
  No, you're not    Ed, you need to heal.
  And healing is about moving on.
  No doubt you're right.
  Of course I'm right.
  I'll go to where she was taken from me  and say good-bye.
  Isabelle would want you to be happy.
  Isabella.
    Of course.
 That's good.
  That's far enough.
    I know what you're thinking, Jim.
  You're thinking,  Why would Captain Nathaniel Barnes,  Mr.
 By-the-book, blow a hole  in this unarmed scumbag?  Could it be that he actually killed Symon, too?  You see, I know that you've been investigating me, Jim.
  - Did you kill Symon? - Is that  what he told you? I know he said something to you before he died.
  Yes, he did.
  Probably the truest words that bastard ever uttered.
  And Paulie Pennies?  He chopped up bodies for murderers.
  You gonna tell me he didn't deserve it?  That's for the law to decide.
  Open your eyes, Jim.
  I am the law.
  What happened to you?  How did you become this?  This  is who I've always been.
  I just needed something to unlock it.
  What are you talking about?  You're just gonna say that I'm sick.
  Well, I'm not.
  I have never been so clear,  so strong in my life.
  Alice Tetch's virus.
  The files on your desk.
 You're infected.
  Oh, you are a detective after all.
  Don't you see?  This means you're innocent.
 We c  we-we can get you help.
  Can we just skip the part  where you try to get me to give myself up?  This isn't you.
 This is the virus.
  No! I'm not insane.
  And you are not seeing the big picture.
  You're gonna frame me for Sugar's murder.
  That's up to you.
  I deal in absolutes.
  Black and white.
  Innocence  and guilt.
  Gotham, the people of this city, need men like me,  men who can see what needs to be done  and have the courage to do it.
  You have it within you  to be one of those men.
  You want me to join you?  - Be a part of this? - Oh, don't be so high and mighty.
  You shot Galavan in cold blood.
  And every day I wish I hadn't!  Thought I didn't have a choice, but I did.
  I lost my freedom.
  I lost Lee.
  I'd give anything to take it all back.
  I didn't say it was easy,  Jim.
  I said it was right.
  Day after day, criminals  thumbing their nose at the law.
  Well, today, I draw a line in the sand.
  Only question is  where do you stand?  Against you.
    Well, I'm disappointed.
  Good-bye, Jim.
 Hey, Sugar! I got a Whoa!  -  -   -  -   The time I knew you feels like a dream.
  And now I'm awake.
  I wish I'd gone on sleeping.
  I will never forget you, my love.
  Good-bye, Isabella.
  We are four blocks from her apartment.
00 p.
m.
 last night?  Uh-huh.
  So d You saw the accident?  Haven't seen nothin' for 20 years.
  But I heard it.
  Girl screaming, Help! Help!  - Then bang! - I'm sorry,  she was screaming before the crash?  Well, she were dead after.
  But you d you definitely heard screaming?  Yep.
 Blood-curdling.
       How odd.
  I'll give him the necklace  and explain there's no need for further violence.
  Maybe I shouldn't be here.
  I kind of hit him over the head with a vase.
  'Course you did.
  Door's open.
  I did not do that.
  We really got to go.
  - Bruce.
 - It was the men that came after us.
  He was killed by the same weapon.
  - I thought they worked for him.
 - Oh, looks like  you were wrong again, Ivy.
  -  - Can we leave now?  Why is this necklace so important?  What'd make someone kill for it?  Who cares?!  Are you crazy? That's worth $5,000.
  Whoa.
 What is it?  A key.
  We should really go, Bruce.
  Oh, my God.
  You two are a couple now?  - No.
 - Yes.
  We're not?  I'm not talking about this right now.
  We need to go somewhere right now.
  And my place is toast, thanks to this dimwit.
  We'll go to my house.
  You just had to come back.
      Alvarez, hey,  - what is all this? - Barnes called in.
  Gordon went loco.
 Shot an unarmed suspect,  then tried taking out Barnes, too.
  No, no, no, no.
 This is not right.
  Harvey, if I was you,  I'd find your partner, have him come in quiet.
  Otherwise, he's going down.
    Jim? Hey.
  Where the hell are you? Half the precinct's looking for you.
  Barnes killed Symon and Paulie Pennies.
  And he just murdered someone right in front of me!  What?  I was gone for, like, an hour.
  He's infected with Alice Tetch's blood.
  He's lost his mind.
 He's trying to kill me.
  - Oh, sweet gentle virgin - I need your help, Harvey.
  - Okay, where are you? - The old foundry.
 Jim? Jim?  J  Harvey, what's going on?  - They said Jim killed someone? - It's a lie.
 It's Barnes.
  It's Barnes.
 He's infected with the Alice Tetch virus.
  Oh, my God.
  He was there when she died.
  Yeah, and I figure we got, like, ten minutes  before those trigger-happy kill-bots find Jim  and take him out.
  Harvey, you have to tell them.
  Come on, they're not gonna believe me.
  But they will believe the medical examiner.
  - What are you asking me to do? - I need you to trust Jim.
  Because right now,  you and I are all he has.
        -  - Stop!  Sorry, Jim.
  End of the line.
    Just as I suspected.
  The brake lines are cut!  How is it  that not one single ignoramus from the GCPD  noticed that the brake lines were cut?  I don't know.
  Someone paid 'em off.
  The question is, who?  Who has that kind of money and influence?  You don't know.
  But I do.
 End of the line.
  No more running.
      Just in time.
 In a few moments,  your brothers in arms are gonna come up those stairs  and find your dead body, and they'll believe me  when I tell them that Jim Gordon is a killer.
  It's a shame, really.
  Could've made a great team.
  Doesn't have to be this way.
  You need help.
  Are those really gonna be your last words?    Nothing to say to Lee?      Go to hell.
 Captain Barnes!  This is Detective Bullock.
  You're under arrest.
  Throw down your weapons  and come out with your hands up.
  We know you killed Symon.
  We know you killed Paulie Pennies.
  We know you killed the suspects in the East End.
  You're infected with the Tetch virus.
  The M.
E.
 has proof.
  Now, we don't want any bloodshed, Cap.
  It's up to you.
  No.
  Thompkins and Bullock.
  They lied for you.
  They turned the whole damn GCPD against me!    We're going in.
 Come on!    Don't.
  You're under arrest.
  Drop it.
  No.
  Don't make me do this.
  I'm not making you do anything.
  Stand down, Jim.
 Let me go.
  If the cops want to hunt me, fine.
  But you  let me go.
  I won't do that.
  You would condemn this city  when I would save it.
  You've got it all wrong.
  You're just the same as I am.
  I just have the guts to admit it.
  No.
  And I'll decide who I am.
  Stand down.
  No.
  Then it is you that is guilty.
      Jim, you okay?  Yeah.
  I'm okay.
  Holy cow.
 Don't get any ideas.
  Okay, Mom.
  Tomorrow we'll look into what this all means.
  Who those men in masks were.
  For now, I'll have Alfred make up beds for you both.
  There's food in the kitchen if you're hungry.
  I could eat.
  Surprise.
  I hope I didn't mess things up with your boyfriend.
  I told you, he's not my boyfriend.
  -  -     What happened?  Are you okay?  Yeah.
  I'm fine.
  And Barnes?  He's alive.
  Bullock told me what you did.
  - It was nothing.
 - No.
  You could've done nothing.
  You didn't.
 I suppose I did  fabricate a blood test stating that my superior  had a psychosis-inducing virus.
  And I'm glad I did.
  Me, too.
  I suppose I better get going.
  Lee?  Thank you.
 Oswald!  Oswald.
 I need to speak with you.
  Yes, but I have to show you something first.
  - This is important.
 - So is this.
  I was not compassionate this morning,  and I regret that.
  What you are going through is terrible.
  So  You put me in your painting.
  The artist went off a photograph,  but I think it's an excellent likeness.
  Isabella was murdered.
  What?  I went to the intersection where she died.
  It is four blocks from her apartment.
  Who falls asleep four blocks from their home? No one.
  Also, a very fragrant homeless man  said that he heard her scream before the crash,  so definitely not asleep.
 Now,  if she were awake, why didn't she brake?  - Why are there no skid marks? - E-Ed, you are exhausted,  you are, you are emotional  Her brake lines were cut!  Which leaves one conclusion.
  Murder.
  - No.
 - Yes.
  And I know who did it.
  Who?  Butch.
  - Butch? - In retaliation.
  For exposing him as the leader of the Red Hood gang.
  That makes perfect sense.
  I swear to you, Ed, we will  find him and make him pay for what he has done.
  Thank you.
  I knew I could count on you.
  I feel like this office is cursed.
  You think Barnes'll be all right?  I don't know.
  I'm sorry I doubted you.
  You didn't.
  Not when it mattered.
  This never happens.
  Oleg!     

                



                


 The infected are being killed all over the city.
 I'm the one you seek.
  I am Ra's al Ghul.
  This man is your past.
  Now embrace your future.
 Use the waters, Bruce.
 You were the one time I let love weaken me.
  I want you around as a constant reminder to never  make that mistake again.
 I heard about Alfred.
  Is he gonna be okay?  You don't give a damn about Alfred,  and you sure as hell don't care about me.
  I know you better than that.
  I thought you did.
 Jonathan Crane's father made a toxin  from the adrenal glands of his victims  - while they experienced terror.
 -   - What do you want? - I'm tired of just surviving.
  I want more.
  I'm sorry, Alfred.
  I've been trying to find who I am for so long.
 You need to find your true north.
  And let that guide you.
        Money! Now!    Hurry up, huh? Give me the ring.
  You have one chance.
 Walk away.
  Who's this?    License.
  I got a license.
         Never gonna give you up   Never gonna let you down   Never gonna run around   And desert you   Never gonna make you cry   Never gonna say good-bye   Never gonna tell a lie   -  And hurt you  -   We've known each other     Nobody move.
    Jewelry, watches, wallets.
 You know the drill.
 Let's go.
 - We want it all.
 All your money.
  - Come on.
 Ah, nice.
 Thank you.
 - Ah.
  Jackpot! Let me see that.
  Ah.
   Cheapskate, huh?    - Come on.
 - Excuse me.
  Hi.
    That's Victor Zsasz.
  I know who it is.
  What do you want?  Oh, I was just passing by.
  Heard the ruckus.
  You know you can't commit a crime in Gotham now  without a license from Penguin, right?  Is that right?  Well, we just started it, so word's still getting out.
  We ain't kicking half our take to that little creep.
  Well that's a problem.
  Maybe you ain't noticed, but there's, uh,  four of us, and only one of you.
  My finger!    No license.
  No crime.
  Now, drop the loot and blow.
  You tell Penguin he hasn't heard the last of this.
 And stay out!    I can't thank you enough.
  Don't bother.
 Because you see those guys?  They do have a license.
  Mazel tov.
    Seriously?    Best wedding ever.
  You know, we appreciate all you've done.
  Do you?  Three months ago, following the Tetch incident,  this city was in flames.
  I came to you and offered to cut crime in half,  and I delivered.
  Violent crime is down 57%.
 But now you want to, uh,  literally, unionize crime.
  - I mean, but we can't possibly - Quiet!    I remember when I sat there, in the mayor's chair.
  I do not envy you.
  Nor you.
  Commissioner of police in a city notorious for crime.
  That's why I want to help.
  But, uh, we are fully aware of all you've done.
  Are you?  What do you think really happened  to those hordes of criminals who once prowled our streets?  I'll tell you.
 I hunted them down  - Oh, no, no, no, no.
 - I made Gotham safe.
  Me.
  But this is Gotham City; there will always be crime.
  What I am offering is crime in the hands of professionals.
  And held to agreed-upon terms.
  From which you'll profit.
  God bless America.
  an era of calm and prosperity  or a return to the good old days.
  And they will return.
  With a vengeance.
  We deny everything to the press.
  Hmm.
  What you need to worry about is the GCPD.
  When one of your officers finds someone committing a crime,  if that person has a license, they walk away.
  Three percent each.
 Uh, from the take.
  Two to split between you.
  - Two and a half.
 - One!  - You - Yes.
 Fine.
 Done.
  Excellent.
  Well, if you'll excuse me,  I have to go prepare for the grand opening of my new club,  - the Iceberg Lounge.
 - Good luck.
  Smile, gentlemen.
 It's a new day.
  Hey, Frank.
  Morning, Jim.
  I'll get you coffee in a second.
  Sure.
  Morning.
  Morning.
 Everything's fine, copper.
  I got a license.
  Penguin approved.
  - Is that right? - Yeah.
  I'll take that coffee to go.
  Man, what the hell are you doing?  - Look, I-I got a license! - Yeah.
  And unless you shut up,  you're also gonna get a fat lip.
 Mr.
 Cobblepot has negotiated them  with the mayor and commissioner.
  These are damn good numbers.
  But I already heard from the commissioner.
  We have to play ball.
 What the hell are you doing here?  Compliance with the licenses is key.
  Mr.
 Cobblepot worries about Detective Gordon.
  He has a history.
  My men will honor the licenses.
 You let me worry about Gordon.
  Now, get the hell out of my office.
  Hmm.
  - Who was that? - A, uh, dung beetle.
  What's up?  I pulled this off of some guy  robbing my corner bar.
  You're a homicide detective.
  Isn't, uh, a stickup a little JV?  I'm a cop.
 I see a crime, I stop it.
  This is the second one of these I've come across,  - and I'm not the only one.
 - Yeah.
  Harvey.
  Harvey, we cannot let this slide.
  Word's come down from the commissioner,  you find someone with one of those, they walk.
   And before you get on your high horse,  three months ago, this city was in a tailspin.
  We survived because Penguin took control of the underworld.
  I am not giving the city over to Penguin.
  - I don't care what the commissioner says.
 - What about your fellow cops, huh?  The past month, how many have been shot? None.
  I know the stats.
  Jim, we will bust Penguin one day, I promise you.
  But this city has to get back on her feet.
  Please?  Harvey, I get that.
  But every day the citizens of Gotham look to Penguin  and not the GCPD to keep them safe,  the harder it's gonna be to win them back.
  You want people to trust cops,  there are better ways of doing it  than spitting in Penguin's eyes.
  You see one of these,  you walk.
 Bloody Penguin.
  There must be some way we can turn this against him.
  Oh, just-just stop.
  Stop right there.
  How does this fit in to what we're doing?  What was the initial reason that you popped on that mask  and you went out there?  We agreed that I have to be ready  for when Ra's al Ghul returns.
  You yourself said there's no substitute for real-world encounters.
  But my point is if that is our mission,  we must hold to it.
  My finger was on the button that released the virus.
  - Oh, I see.
 - I know I didn't press it,  but I feel responsible for what happened.
  And more than that, I can make a difference in Gotham, Alfred.
 I know I can.
  And that is what we call mission creep, Master Bruce.
  You're trying to achieve not one but two objectives.
  So, go on, then.
  Which one is your priority?  It's messy, sir.
  It's dangerous.
  I hear you, Alfred.
  But I can prepare myself for Ra's  and make Gotham safer.
  You have to trust me.
    MAN (over P.
A.
 All inmates, last call in five minutes,  make your way to the door and the nearest    This way.
  Hey, Warden Reed.
  Warden Reed's the boss here.
            Where is he?  This way.
    Back when I was an orderly in here,  he'd always talk about his dad and this formula he'd made.
  Some sort of scare juice.
  Make you see your greatest fear.
  We get ahold of that,  we don't got to worry about Zsasz or Penguin,  or nobody.
  What's wrong with him, anyway?  The toxin his father injected him with  overloaded Jonathan's fear response.
  His mind created a sort of boogieman figure.
  Now it haunts him.
  I find it very useful for  controlling him.
  Jonathan, you're going with these men.
  What? Wait.
 Where are you taking me?  We just want to give someone a little scare.
  Excellent.
 Yeah.
  That's all, that's all my dad's stuff.
  Look, I can't be here after dark, please.
  I real I cannot be here after  You were your daddy's little assistant, weren't you?  You helped with the experiments.
  Some, but I don't know everything!  Now, you're gonna take your daddy's notebooks  and make as much of that fear juice as I say.
  And so you don't get lonely,  the boys here brought you a friend.
 No.
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
 Hey.
 You have a license?    Look at me.
 Fiery demons.
 Demons.
  Fiery demons.
  - Demons.
 - Demons.
 Yeah, yeah.
  Yeah, we'll catch them.
 Get him out of here.
  - Go, go, go, go.
 Fiery demons.
  Hey.
  Did Penguin issue a license for this?  Why you asking me?  Best of my knowledge, no.
  Then why do something so public?  Unless you're trying to send Penguin a message.
  I hope the message was Please send Victor Zsasz down here  to kill me, because that's exactly what's gonna happen.
  - Not if I find them first.
 - Hey!  You asked me to stop busting crooks with licenses.
  This gang didn't have a license.
  And you're gonna find them before Zsasz  just to prove that GCPD still matters?  That's not thumbing your nose at Penguin?  - Fire me.
 - Hey, don't tempt me.
  You got a lead?  The victims, the way they're acting,  their terror reminds me of Crane's formula.
  You think someone's using the fear juice?  It ain't him.
 He's dead, remember?  Not that that matters much in this town anymore.
  He's dead.
 His son isn't.
 Jonathan Crane's condition is fragile.
  - I'm afraid he can't see anyone.
 -   Certainly not the two men who killed his father.
 436 total.
  We mustn't call them loonies.
  - Course not.
 -   How about staff that had access to Crane?  Any of them not show up for work?  All present and accounted for.
  You don't want to check?  - I don't need to.
 - See, that's impressive.
  'Cause I run a precinct, and if half my cops  - didn't show up, I'd be none the wiser.
 - It's true.
 He wouldn't.
  Clearly we have different professional standards.
    Jonathan Crane's father  created a toxin that makes people see their greatest fear.
  This morning, it was used to rob a bank.
  How is that my problem?  Let me explain it to you.
  See, whoever robbed the bank,  they challenged Penguin.
  And all we have to do  is tell Penguin that you're involved,  and he'll send Victor Zsasz down here to talk to you.
  Jim, how would you describe Victor?  Victor Zsasz?  A homicidal maniac and sadist.
  A homicidal maniac and sadist  of the highest professional standards.
  So you can talk with us here and now,  or you can talk to Victor.
  They threatened me; I had no choice.
  We want a name, putz.
 I knew it rang a bell.
 Grady Harris.
  Ran a crew a few years back.
  Him and his cousin Merton.
  Couple of cowboys from the sticks.
  Grady!  GCPD!  GCPD!    -  - Well, well.
  Look at what we got here.
  What's wrong with you pigs? Harassing honest fellas like us,  when there's real criminals out there.
  You robbed a bank in broad daylight.
  - That don't make you a criminal? - I'm an outlaw!  Outlaws have a code.
    -  - Criminals,  they'll take everything.
  They'll take a man's livelihood.
  Like the Penguin.
  And his licenses.
  But we're gonna show him, you'll see.
    Penguin wouldn't give you a license  if you begged him till the cows came home, you stupid hick!   You're lucky I'm not the Penguin.
  We would gut you right here.
  We're better than them!  Take care, pigs.
            - They see him anyway.
 - Hey, check it out.
 Ooh.
  - Looking for company? -   She all by herself.
  Just let me go, okay?  Not a chance.
  Don't say I didn't warn you.
        Don't turn your back on a guy unless you're sure he's down.
  Otherwise, not bad.
  Does this mean we can get pizza?    I'm just saying, you steal my pepperoni again,  I'll break your fingers.
  So you're saying do steal your pepperoni again?  I come in peace.
  You ladies were not easy to track down.
  Then again, I can see why you don't advertise.
  Didn't you used to be rich?  That was before your boss stole my club.
  Well, you murdered his mom  and tried to kill him.
  So call it even?  There a reason you're here?  You know about these?  The boss can't have you operating on your own.
  Now, he could just kill you,  but he figures it's time to let bygones be bygones.
  How big of him.
  Tomorrow night's the opening of his club.
  Come by, kiss the ring,  get your license.
  Is that pepperoni?  Goes without saying, this is one of those  or else kind of deals.
  Later.
  We got to find a new place.
  Why? We join Penguin, we can at least get work.
  I came to you because I wanted to move up.
  And look around.
  We're barely making it.
  I'm not working for him.
  Now, pack.
 Detective Gordon.
  Bruce.
  I didn't hear you.
  What happened?  Uh, nothing.
  Harvey and I were tracking a gang.
  We let ourselves get surprised.
  What brings you down here?  I found this when I was in the city.
  Wasn't sure what to do with it.
  One of Penguin's licenses.
  Apparently, crime is legal now.
  And you're going along with that?  Not really.
  There's a number on the license.
  I was thinking Penguin must have some sort of master list.
  Connecting the crime and the criminal to the license issued.
  List like that would tell you  not only who committed that crime,  but crimes that haven't even happened yet.
  Unfortunately, the judges are going along with the licenses.
  I'm trying to track down  who in Penguin's organization keeps the list.
  It would set off too many alarms.
  I see.
  But you haven't given up.
  You just said you were out tracking a gang.
  That's different.
  This gang isn't licensed.
  But  Penguin will come after them, if he hasn't already.
  And when he catches them,  it'll be more proof that Gotham doesn't need the GCPD.
  Sorry, it's been a long day.
  So why not use Penguin to lead you to them?  If I could figure out how to do that, I would.
  It was good to see you, Detective.
  You should come by the house for dinner.
  Yes.
  I'd like that.
  How about we grab a bite  tonight?  Exclusive, but welcoming.
  Urbane and edgy.
  Tonight's opening will establish the Iceberg Lounge  as Gotham's newest place to see and be seen.
  And you say you acquired the club from Barbara Kean?  Is that a question?  It's just, no one's seen her for months, and  Well, Barbara Kean's whereabouts  are not my concern.
  This was The Sirens club.
 It is now mine.
 Mr.
 Cobblepot,  there's a rumor going around about criminals  being given licenses.
  The rumor is you're issuing them.
  Tell me, what is the crime rate in Gotham?  - We're at historic lows.
 - Historic lows.
  You know, Augustus Caesar once presided  over the longest period of peace and prosperity  the world has ever known.
  It was called the Pax Romana.
  Perhaps one day, this will be known as  the Pax Penguina.
   That's not a denial.
  We're here to talk about my club.
    Your readers will find this interesting.
 Ivy?      That's Edward Nygma.
  Turns out Ed had a very rare brain disease.
  to freeze him and wait for the cure.
  In his final lucid moments,  he begged me, Oswald, do not hide me away.
  Put me out with the people.
  It was the least I could do.
  Anyone tell him he was being frozen?  I have affidavits from his doctor,  - if you would like to see them.
 - No, thanks.
  Well, Jim,  I'm rather busy.
  So whatever your business is  I came to tell you you're a fraud.
  The gang that has Crane's fear toxin,  they're not afraid of you.
  Others will find out.
 That's how it begins.
 You've had a nice run, Oswald,  but it's over.
  Oh, Jim,  it's so hard to admit when you've become irrelevant.
  Let me tell you what's gonna happen.
  I'm going to find this gang,  and I'm going to crush them.
  And everyone will see that it is Oswald Cobblepot,  the Penguin, who keeps Gotham safe.
  Always good to see you, old friend!  As he prepares for the opening of the Iceberg Lounge,  Oswald Cobblepot announced that he would destroy the gang  that attacked Gotham First National Bank yesterday.
  He described them as cowards and pond scum.
    Penguin's going down tonight.
  - You finish that new batch yet? - Yes.
  Now, can you please, can you please get rid of that, please?   What, you and him ain't getting along?  Please, just get rid of it!  Listen, I got to do some things tonight,  but I think you guys should spend some time together,  - huh? - No, please.
  We all have our fears to face.
  Stop, stop! Please!  Stop, please!  No!  Stop!    Let me out!  Remember how you accused me of being a slave to my emotions?  No more.
  I have banished those feelings.
  And look how I have risen.
  But at what cost?  I wonder which of us is frozen.
  Him.
  He's, like, totally frozen.
  Ivy, go somewhere else.
  All right, I want two unmarked units at street level,  and another two teams with me and Harvey  watching the entrances to the club.
  The moment that gang arrives, we move.
  You heard the man.
  Suit up! Let's go!  Can we count on them?  Let's see, you tricked Penguin into baiting the gang  to attack his club, hoping to arrest them  before they cause mass panic, only so you could  embarrass Penguin, so I would say yeah,  they're about as dependable as any other part  - of this cockamamie plan.
 - Thanks.
  I'll get the gas masks.
 Jonathan.
  Let me out!  Jonathan!    - So you guys work for Penguin, huh? - It ain't like that.
  - Sure.
 - Come on, Gordon.
  Since Penguin's been cracking down, life's been good.
  Why you got to rock the boat?    What happens when he starts giving out licenses for murders?  Huh?  What then?  I'm wasting my breath, aren't I?  Pretty much.
  All right, then.
  Who wants it first?      Mr.
 Wayne, Mr.
 Pennyworth.
  I am so glad you could make it.
  It's our pleasure.
  - Congratulations.
 -   We were just admiring your frozen mate.
  Is he still alive in there?  I fear we may never know.
  Well, you'll know when you finally thaw him out.
  When they discover a cure for his disease.
  Oh, yes.
 Then, of course.
  I wanted to personally thank you  for everything you've done for this city.
  Thank you, Mr.
 Wayne.
  So  can I ask about the licenses?  Uh, a little discretion, if you would, Master Bruce.
  Everybody's talking about it, Alfred.
  I just want to know how it works.
  So, does someone come to you and say  I want to rob a bank?    Now, Bruce, if I didn't know any better,  I would think that you wanted me to implicate myself.
  Anything you say stays between us.
  First, let me ask  you would be agreeable to the idea of licensed crime?  If crime had been licensed and controlled three years ago,  my parents would still be alive.
  Exactly so.
  Well, between us,  I have nothing to do with the licenses directly.
  I provide the guidelines while Mr.
 Penn  handles all of the details.
  Now would you excuse me?  - Well done, sir.
 - Thank you.
  Now we know who has the list.
  The next step is  Selina.
  Where's your babysitter?  - It's kind of a package deal.
 - Yeah.
 Well, he's got me.
 Actually,  we're both in.
  I should  - pat you down for weapons.
 - Sure.
  If you want to lose a hand.
  It was worth a shot.
  I'll tell the boss.
  See ya.
  You were worried about me.
    Hey, man, I been looking all over for you.
  Ooh, ouch.
  Think we can forget about backup.
  I see you talked to some of your fellow officers.
  - Probably not a bad thing.
 - How's that?  Guys get to let off steam, resentments don't fester.
  Next time, you can get punched in the face.
  This beautiful mug? No one would dare.
  Let's go.
    All right, once inside, gas Zsasz and Penguin first,  and then go crazy.
  I still don't see Penguin.
 Hello!  I'm guessing that gas isn't faster than a bullet.
  What do you think?  Jim Gordon and his ham-fisted manipulation.
  He thought he fooled me.
 You want to do 'em here or downstairs?  - Might be a little loud in here.
 - Neither.
  I have something special planned for them.
  What do you want, Bruce?  You knew I'd follow you.
  Just like I knew you'd come up here.
  You don't know anything about me.
  I wanted to apologize for what I said at the hospital  when you came to visit Alfred.
  You were making a kind gesture.
  You want to talk to me, come up here.
  My point is I'm sorry.
  Yeah.
  You were a jerk.
  I saw you arrive with Tabitha Galavan.
  I'm not sure I'd choose her as a mentor.
  Wow.
  That means absolutely nothing to me.
  Selina  Oh?  You you want to say something?  That's a lovely dress you're wearing tonight.
  Honestly, you two.
  Why can't you just go to the cinema like normal teenagers?  Uh, Master Bruce, we got a bit of a  bit of a situation downstairs.
  What sort of situation?  Miss Kyle.
 For the past three months, I have given this city  a tranquility it has never known.
  Now I would like to ensure that peace for the future.
  In the weeks to come,  you will hear whispers  about what's happening in the streets of Gotham.
  All you need to know is without me  this is what you get.
  Men who want to bring fear back to our city,  who promise a return to the old days.
  So tell your families,  tell your friends,  it is Oswald Cobblepot who keeps them safe,  not the GCPD.
  You're welcome!  I have my things in the car.
 We can stop them in the parking garage.
  Absolutely not, Master Bruce.
  Alfred, Penguin is gonna take those men out and kill them.
  Undoubtedly so  but as you said before, you can make a difference.
  There is a time for masks,  and there is a time for Bruce Wayne.
 Wait!  I want to know what you're going to do with those men.
  You need not concern yourself with that.
  Are those men going to be turned over to the police?    Earlier tonight, you thanked me for making the city safer.
  Now, how do you think that happened?  I do the dirty work no one else will.
  I understand.
  But I'm asking you,  turn those men over to the police.
  You're young.
  You have a good heart.
  No.
  Enjoy your party, Penguin.
  You little twerp.
 Hey!  -  - You're under arrest,  by order of the Gotham City Police Department.
 Cuff him.
 Penguin ain't gonna be too happy.
  Screw him.
  I'm just worried about finding Jonathan Crane.
  If he's out there, with access to his father's formula  Relax.
 We'll find him.
  I wouldn't expect too much help from these parts, though.
  There's good cops out there.
 They just need reminding.
 You have a list  of all the licenses you've given; I want it.
  I I can't.
 Forget it.
  We got a license, remember?      Guys, come on.
      Oh, no.
 GCPD!  Gotham Police! You're under arrest!  Crane! You got to make more of that fear gas.
 Jonathan Crane isn't here anymore.
      Just the Scarecrow.
          

                



                


 I found this when I was in the city.
 Penguin's licenses.
 Apparently crime is legal now.
  I got a license.
 I am not giving the city over to Penguin.
  I don't care what the commissioner says.
  Oswald Cobblepot  keeps your friends safe.
  Not the GCPD.
  - Is Barbara around? - No.
 And she's not coming back.
  I want more.
    Jonathan Crane's father  created a toxin that makes people  - see their greatest fear.
 -   Jonathan, you're going with these men.
 Now, you're gonna take your daddy's notebooks  and make as much of that fear juice as I say.
      -  - Oh, no.
 Jonathan Crane  isn't here anymore.
  It's just the Scarecrow.
 This is where Merton said they would be.
  Let's go, everybody.
  - Stay sharp.
 -   There's no one here.
  They're long gone by now.
  This place smells like death.
  Reminds me there's a Thai joint not far away,  if you want to grab something to eat after.
  - Very funny.
 - It's the toxin.
  And they made more of it.
 Looky here.
  An asylum uniform.
 Right, thank you very much, Officer.
    Alfred, you need to explain this was just a misunderstanding.
  Worry not, Master Bruce, we have Wayne Enterprises'  most talented and expensive lawyer on the case.
  He'll have you out in a jiffy.
  How'd they nick you, anyway?  I fell through the skylight.
  These thieves must have triggered an alarm.
  The police were so quick to respond.
 I wasn't expecting that, Alfred.
  Yeah, well, you could have broke your bloody neck.
  I had them red-handed.
  - If I could've only - Only what?  Only taken on an entire crew twice your size?  Perhaps, yes.
 Well, here's something you don't see every day.
  Bruce Wayne behind bars.
  There's been a terrible mistake, Detective Gordon.
  You see, I fell in from the roof into a robbery in progress.
  - I wasn't breaking in.
 - Is that so?  Why were you up on the roof?  I was looking for Selina Kyle.
    I see.
 Yes.
 Uh, we will, of course, have our lawyer  post bail, Detective Gordon.
  I hardly think that's necessary.
    We'll talk more about this, Bruce.
  But not tonight.
  Thank you, Detective.
    Thank you.
 Locking 'em up.
  Everybody in bed.
 Everybody in bed.
      Covering your dirty footprints, Warden?  It's too late, I'm afraid.
  Your dirty deeds have  stained you.
  - How did you get in here? - Come on.
  You don't spend three years in this hellish place  - without picking up a thing or two.
 -   Jonathan?  That's right.
  I'm not the same frightened boy you threw in a cell.
  No treatments, no therapy.
  Just some ice baths and some   electric shocks, once in a while.
  You know, you could just leave.
  I wouldn't tell anyone.
  I don't want to leave, Warden.
    - Oh! - Now, are you paying attention?!  Yeah.
  I cured myself.
  You see, I feared the scarecrow.
  - And now we are one.
 - Jonathan  please, if you'll just  You're not listening to me, Warden!  Jonathan Crane is no more.
  Call me by my true name.
 The Scarecrow.
 No, he fell through a skylight.
  He was on the rooftops, looking for Selina Kyle.
  Bloody teenagers, eh? Ooh.
  But your clothes looks more like  concrete and stone residue, though.
  What were you doing before that?  Rock climbing.
  - Rock climbing.
 - Yes, we were rock climbing.
  Alfred's been teaching me.
  At the rock faces in  the s-south gardens.
  Taken to it like a duck to water, he has.
  But we've got to plod on, Mr.
 Fox.
  Of course.
 Sorry to have kept you.
  Be careful on those rocks, Bruce.
  It's a dangerous sport.
  We will, Mr.
 Fox.
 We will.
    Did you know my father was a genius?  He wanted to end fear.
  For my sake.
  Because he loved me.
  what do you fear, Warden?  Something from your  childhood, maybe?      Face your fears.
  Face your fears, and defeat them.
 What? No.
    Brothers and sisters.
  Look at you.
  Prisoners,  all of you.
  My father would have freed you.
  But he was killed.
  Murdered by the GCPD.
  Men who couldn't understand.
    But they will.
  For you will be my army.
    And those men who killed my father  shall truly know fear.
        James Gordon?  James Gordon?  There you are.
  Play nice.
  No.
  I see you've caught one of them.
  What about the other fellow?  I have no idea who you're talking about.
  Jonathan Crane?  People share with me  because they trust me to get things done.
  Unlike you.
  So, this boy who created this lethal toxin  which almost killed me where is he?  - Whereabouts unknown, for now.
 -   Why am I not surprised? I mean, really,  the only thing the GCPD knows how to do well is fail.
  What is a penguin  a bird or a mammal?  Bird.
  It is a bird.
  an outdated, ineffectual and corrupt institution.
  How much longer must our citizens  suffer their incompetence?  This, coming from a man who takes money  from criminals in exchange for a license  allowing them to victimize innocent people.
  And it is working.
  Jim, why can't you see that  I am not here to destroy your beloved GCPD,  but to save it.
  And, through that, Gotham.
  Your licenses are illegal  and I will arrest anyone I find who is issued one.
  So sure your Boy Scout morality  can protect this city, Jim?   How well has that worked in the past?  Should I list the victims  of your antiquated righteousness?  Instead, let me make you a deal.
 Good for you, Jim.
  Game on.
    What are you doing here?  Have I taught you nothing?  I could've slit your throat before you even saw me.
  I found this on the door this morning.
  An Opportunity Awaits.
  Someone left this inside last night.
    Thank you for coming, ladies.
  No way.
  I saw you die.
   That so?  This is Gotham.
  - Check for a pulse next time.
 I will.
  Right after I slit your throat.
 So, what happened to you?  Long story.
  Right now, all you need to know is that I'm back.
  And like the card says,  an opportunity awaits you.
  A new beginning.
  You sure you want to get this close?  Please hear me out.
  Not a day goes by where I don't think about what I did.
  If I could take it back, trust me,  I would.
  I wouldn't mind a do-over myself.
  Perhaps I'll finish the job this time.
  I was jealous.
  I was stupid.
  I am sorry.
  Kill me if you don't believe me.
 So, is this your place now?  This is our place.
  Another club? In Gotham?  How original.
  It's not a club.
      Penguin's taking over.
  Like it or not,  every criminal in the city  is gonna go to him for a license to mug,  steal, or blow stuff up.
  Those criminals are gonna need supplies,  and that is where we come in.
  Not only will we be able to facilitate these lowlives,  but we'll also find out what they're planning  and how it's going down.
  But I will not go forward without you both.
  This is our way back on top.
  No.
  What you took from me,  I will never be able to get back.
  Just feel lucky I don't burn this place to the ground.
      This will be good for all of us.
  Please talk to her.
      I don't want to hear it, Alfred.
  I'm going back out there.
  I'm not gonna let this trail go cold.
  Far be it from me to stop you, Master Bruce.
  You're not coming?  No, sir.
  And why not?  Because, as last night proved, you  are simply not ready.
  Yeah, you can chuck a punch, you can block one.
  You're quick on your toes, I'll give you that.
  What if they got guns, Master Bruce?  Out there,  Alfred, I feel more alive than I've ever felt before.
  Do you understand that?  And that is precisely why I am not stopping you, sir.
  But you'll excuse me if I don't want to stand by  and watch you get shot.
      Hey.
 The mental asylum's under siege.
  The lunatics are running riot.
  The guards called it in before they bolted for the hills.
  - Crane? - He made more toxins, right?  What happens when you dose a hundred nutjobs?  All right, listen up!  There's a riot at the asylum!  I need as many of you as can come!  Who's with me?  Good luck with that.
  You really think Penguin is gonna make this go away?!  He's just getting rich off the same lowlives  you guys used to hate as much as me!  Ah, forget it.
  Not one of you is fit to wear the badge.
 Yeah, he's right.
 That's what I'm saying.
  Let's go, Harvey.
  Come on.
 Don't do this.
  I told you, one day, that you would say, Now or never.
  And I would say, Never.
 Well, today is that day.
  If I go with you, I lose them.
  And then who's gonna be the new captain, huh?  Because it's damn well gonna be someone Penguin chooses.
  So I am sorry, partner,  but you are on your own on this one.
  Yeah.
    -  -     GCPD!  GCPD.
      I'm not scared of you anymore! You see, I am you!           Ah.
 It's you.
      You came.
  - (feedback over P.
A.
 Brothers and sisters,  the enemy is here.
      Crap.
    Tonight, Detective,  you will pay for what you've done.
  Tonight, you will know fear.
        -  - Get him.
  Keep going, keep going.
      All right, Mr.
 Cop,  let's have some real fun.
        My, my!  Well, come on in, I guess.
  Word was you were dead.
   Imagine my surprise when I hear  you've popped back up, alive,  and gone and opened a brand-new business.
    - Ooh.
 - We're not open yet.
  - Looks pretty open to me.
 -   Yeah, I'd say it's open.
  Hot damn, it's like Christmas.
  Which is upsetting, because this was definitely something  you would want to run by me first.
  Is it, now?  Oh, yes, absolutely.
  All enterprises pertaining to the criminal underworld shall,  from this time forth, be approved, monitored,  - and taxed by me.
 - Hmm.
  My apologies.
  I'm still waiting for my partners to come aboard.
 Who?  Tabitha?  Selina?  - Perhaps.
 - Well, good luck with that.
  Slippery characters, the both of them.
  Also, people can often carry grudges  after you shoot their boyfriends.
  I could talk to them, if you want.
  I distinctly remember saying you could come  if you kept your mouth shut.
  You will need an operating license, obviously.
  Then pay a weapon tax.
  - Weapon tax? - And then,  perhaps your little store can open.
  Well, you don't ask for much now, do you?  I am not asking for enough.
  Let me be absolutely clear, Miss Kean.
  I will be keeping a very close eye on you.
  The first rumor I hear about you and your little partners  making moves to contest me, and Victor      will end you with your own merchandise.
  Understood.
  Couldn't have been cheap.
  I'm sorry?  You lost your money on The Sirens Club,  then went missing.
  Rumor was you were dead.
  And now you're back with a brand-new fancy place.
  Who paid for it?    You really think I won't find out who it is?    Ah.
  I'm gonna take this.
            Crane?      Do you believe in fate?  I didn't before today,  but you, sir, have made me a believer.
  Of all the police in Gotham, it was you.
  You came.
    Jonathan.
  What happened to you?  Well, first you killed my father.
  Your father was insane.
 He was trying to kill you.
  He tried to help me,  help all mankind.
  - He was a murderer.
 - He was a pioneer!  A genius!  He taught me we can live  our entire lives imprisoned by our fears,  or we can embrace them.
 You should know that better than anyone.
  You should know that better than anyone.
 What will you see, I wonder?  One of your victims, perhaps?  One of your victims?  What haunts you the most?          Lee?    I just  I just was  God, no.
  - What have you done? - Don't touch me!  Let me go!  Please let me help you.
 You've caused me so much pain.
    I've suffered you long enough.
  We could have been a family,  had a child.
  You destroy everything you touch.
  I just  want peace.
  No.
 Lee.
  No.
  You can join her  to show her how much you truly love her.
  Don't let her die hating you.
  It's what she would want.
  It's the only way  to show her, love her.
 Cut deep.
  Cut deep.
 It's what she would want.
  Cut deep and find peace.
  Don't let her die.
  - Follow her - No.
  - into death.
 She wouldn't say that.
  She wouldn't want that.
 She loves me.
  - Cut deep and find peace.
 - No.
  She loves me.
 She loves me.
 She wouldn't want that.
  She loves me.
 No.
  Crane? Where are you?  - Crane? -   How did you do it?  How did you defeat the toxin? It's impossible!  I overcame my fear.
  Liar!  You liar!  You can't just stop being afraid.
    You can only become your demon like I did.
  No.
 You have a choice, Jonathan.
  And whatever your father was, he didn't want this for you.
  You need help.
    My father thought that I was weak.
  My whole life.
  Scared little Jonathan.
  Okay.
 I can help you.
  Let me help you.
  But I'm not weak anymore.
  And I will never go back to being that boy.
      Come on, man.
 Right this way.
  No.
  Down this way.
 Right at the back.
    Just around the corner.
  I'm telling you, man.
 He leaves the back gate open.
   It's gonna be too easy.
    Well, well.
    It seems we've caught our stalker.
  - And he made it way too easy.
 -   Didn't know when he was being played.
  -  - Who are you, huh?  Some some Boy Scout?  - He's just a kid.
 -   You some some kind of do-gooder?  Did I date your mom and not call her back?    Why are you hassling us, kid?  I don't know, guys.
 His face, it seems familiar.
  You famous or something?  You know we got licenses for this, kid?  We're all above board.
  - Penguin gets his share.
 - That's right.
  It's within our rights to do anything we want to you.
  - Anything.
 -   Look what you went and did.
  You've seen my stash.
  And you ticked off my boys.
  Now you got to die.
  Wait, wait, wait.
 I'm telling you, I know this kid's face.
  Oh, would you shut the hell up.
  Hey, I'm telling you, I've seen this dude.
  Don't matter.
  - No matter who he is -   he's got to go.
  -  -     Ah, get up.
  Hurry up, he's getting away.
  Think you're so slick, huh?    Now, I hate to tell you I told you so, Master Bruce.
  Up you get.
  You got to leave.
  - She said she's sorry.
 She chose  Nygma over me and Butch.
  So, Nygma's a Popsicle now.
  Let's give her a chance.
  - Why do you want this so bad? - Because  I'm sick and tired of not being taken seriously.
  Of all those selfish guys out there  who treat me like I'm stupid.
  Alone, I can't do much about it.
  With Barbara maybe.
  But with you and Barbara?  The three of us  could give all those creeps a run for their money.
 I want in.
  - Get out.
 - No, no.
 Please, just hear me out.
 No.
  You're a Penguin stooge.
  What? I hate that freak.
  Oh, please.
 You guzzled down his Kool-Aid.
 Beat it.
  No one takes me seriously, either.
  There's nothing I wouldn't do to get back  at the men who've treated me like garbage.
  - Nothing.
 Not buying it.
  You're working for Penguin.
  Cool down, okay? I believe her.
  Thank you.
  Know what?  You're rude.
  And you're about to get your skinny ass kicked down the block.
  I won't ask again.
  Get out.
    Get word to Barbara.
  I'll talk business.
  But I'll need something in return.
 The demon is here.
  The demon who haunts and tortures you is here.
  The one who poisoned your minds.
  Destroy him and free yourself from his tyranny!    Kill him!  Water, right.
      Ah.
  I'm so happy.
 Jonathan.
      - You could have been killed! - But I wasn't.
  That's 'cause I followed you.
  - I had it under control.
 - How am I supposed to support you  if you refuse to accept the realities of the situation?  - Alfred, the realities of the situation -     Mr.
 Fox.
  - Bad time? - No.
  Not at all.
  Please come in.
  Forgive me.
  I should have called, but  Well, I just couldn't stop thinking about our last chat.
  Wayne Enterprises were developing a durable material  for military uniforms when I worked there.
    It is a thin Kevlar weave with reinforced forearm protection.
  The gloves have a faceted grip design  to help you cling to any surface.
  The whole uniform is extremely lightweight,  and actually, bulletproof  to impacts from 10 feet or more.
  You know, for rock climbing.
  Oh, and long distance radio communicators.
  In case you two wish to talk to each other  whilst climbing rock.
  Well, I will not keep you.
  I just didn't want to see you get hurt again, Mr.
 Wayne.
  Thank you, Mr.
 Fox.
  I feel safer already.
    Ladies.
 Thank you for returning.
  - I'm glad - Not so fast.
  I'll be needing proof of your sincerity.
  Yes.
 Selina said you would need something from me.
  You can have anything you like.
  Fine.
  I'll take your hand.
  - My what? - Both Butch and I  lost a hand due to Penguin's Machiavellian war games.
  I believe it's your turn.
  - You didn't say anything about this.
 - Quiet.
  - Tabitha, I assure you - No more words.
  Penguin cut off Butch's hand, Nygma mine.
  Now I take yours.
  Fine.
  If this is the only way I can get you to trust me  so be it.
  Fine.
 I'll trust you.
  For now.
  - I'll start Monday.
 Where is he?  We had a deal, Detective Gordon.
  That you would apprehend Jonathan Crane.
  You made a demand in front of your cronies  in an attempt to undermine me and this department.
  There was no deal.
  I spoke for all of the citizens of Gotham  when I said that the GCPD can no longer keep us safe.
 I say it is time to start anew.
  To police ourselves.
    I will triple the wage of any cop here  who wants to work for me  in insuring the safety of this city's people.
  The future is now.
  Follow me into it.
 Police yourselves.
  He just wants to pay you to look the other way.
  Would you blame him if they did?  - I've got nothing to say to you.
 - Hey, hey, hey.
  This is a war, not one battle.
  If I would have went with you, I would have lost them.
  And we need them to win this war.
  Now you don't have to say nothing,  but I'm buying you a drink.
  -  -   Oh, no.
 Not you.
  Leave.
  You never paid for the last stuff I gave you.
  You make me smell perfume,  make me giddy cheap trick.
  Out! Out!  I'm done with perfumes.
  I'm here for the good stuff.
  Don't know what you're talking about.
  Leave.
 I'm closing up.
  Word is you have potions here.
  Ancient, mystical potions made by shamans all over the world.
  Who told you that?  I'm done playing nice.
  I need a change, a big one.
  I need strength, power.
  - No.
 - Where are they?  My safe.
  Under the register.
  Combination?  It's open.
    Which ones make me stronger?  That's dangerous stuff.
 It's too powerful for you.
  It can get in your blood, your DNA.
  Good.
 No!  Don't! No!  - No! You must stop! -       You let me walk into that nightmare alone.
  Yeah, well, I figured it would take  more than a couple of loonies to take you out.
  Besides, I figured you and me taking on Penguin  and the entire criminal underground  by ourselves wasn't the best idea.
  So what? You want to sit here, do nothing, get drunk?  Is that your plan? Unless you got a better one.
  What makes you think those cops back there were wrong?  Are we really making a difference?  One worth risking our lives over?  We'd need an army to take on Penguin.
  Makes me miss Falcone.
  I mean, I know he's a vicious bastard  but he was, he was fair.
  He ran the criminals of this city with an iron fist.
  There was, th-there was, there was honor.
  - No, no, no, no, no.
 - What?  Do not mess with Falcone.
  You killed his son, remember?  Italians do not forget that crap.
  He must hate what Penguin's doing as much as we do.
  You show your face to Falcone, he will kill you.
  Yeah.
 Well  Like you said, we need an army.
  He's got one.
 Ooh, that's a lovely leap,  Master Bruce; positively gazelle-like.
 It's so lightweight, it's like I'm wearing nothing at all.
 Yeah, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
  Remember to keep your face covered at all times.
      

                



                


                    			1 - Previously on Gotham - You know you can't commit  a crime in Gotham without a license from Penguin.
 Tell your families  Oswald Cobblepot  keeps them safe,  not the GCPD.
 We'd need an army to take on Penguin.
  I am not giving the city over to Penguin.
  I don't care what the commissioner says.
  Makes me miss Falcone.
  I'm done with this business.
 I'm out.
  I've got a place down south I can go to.
  We need an army.
 He's got one.
 You show your face to Falcone,  he will kill you.
 An opportunity awaits you.
  Why do you want this so bad?  I'm sick of not being taken seriously.
  With you and Barbara,  the three of us could give all those creeps  a run for their money.
  You were the one time I let love weaken me.
 And I want you around  as a constant reminder  to never make that mistake again.
 I'm the one you seek.
  I am Ra's al Ghul.
 I have to be ready for when Ra's al Ghul returns.
 You need to find your true north  and let that guide you.
        It is you.
  At last.
      I was no more.
  And now you live.
  How can this be?  The power is in the water.
  It has given you life and a destiny.
  You must find your heir, as I found you.
  Find him.
  Be free.
       Alfred, you read?  Loud and clear, Master Bruce.
  Looks like the rumors around town are true.
  Penguin's bringing in a big shipment.
  Whatever it is, it must be valuable.
  He's got four armed men loading it onto a truck.
  I'm gonna go down for a closer look.
  How did I know you were gonna say that, then?  I'm wearing bulletproof armor, remember?  Yes.
  Lucius Fox's armor was bulletproof.
  My mask is not.
  Don't get shot in the face? Got it.
  Do I detect a note of sarcasm, Master Bruce?  Hold on.
  I just picked up a thief heading toward the truck.
  Thieves stealing from thieves  is a victimless crime, Master Bruce.
  You just walk away now.
  They're walking into a trap.
  Master Bruce,  I'm all for you protecting the innocent,  but I won't have you risking your life  over a thief.
  Now walk away.
 The hell are you supposed to be?    Must be real stupid trying to steal from Penguin.
  Bad idea.
 Hold him!    Let's get out of here!  Come on.
  In the truck!    Damn it.
        Hola, seÃ±or.
  Can I help you?  James Gordon.
  I'm here to see Carmine Falcone.
  He's not expecting me.
  Come with me, please.
    Carmine.
  Jim.
  You're a long way from home.
  Came down to see you, Carmine.
  Heard you retired down here.
  Sorry for not calling ahead.
  No, you're not.
  It's quite the spread you have here.
  I think we're past the point of small talk, Jim.
  Just tell me why you're here.
  Morning, Daddy.
 He's feisty,  as usual, but I whipped him into shape.
 James Gordon.
  Jim, meet my  only daughter, Sofia.
  What are you doing here, James?  Go ahead, Jim.
  I have no secrets from my children.
  Penguin has taken over the city.
  The GCPD has turned its back on Gotham.
  There are families that are still loyal to you.
  I need your help to knock him off his perch.
  Sure this isn't about you, Jim?  Your loss of power in Gotham?  This is bigger than me.
  You have fight, kid.
  I've always admired that in you.
  But I can't do what you ask.
  Why?  Because I'm dying.
  Doctors don't know why.
  Maybe old age.
  Karma.
  They seem to think the air is better down here for me,  give me more time.
  I'm not one to argue with doctors.
  Or time.
  So, you see, I can't go back with you.
  I'll go back.
  Hush.
  You're not ready for Gotham.
  There was a time in my life  when I would have done anything for the city.
  Those days are gone.
  I'm sorry, Jim.
  You're on your own.
  You sure you know what you're doing?    You're mad because I didn't listen to you, Alfred.
  You're damn bloody right I am, yeah.
  You're right.
  - I let my guard down.
 -   It won't happen again.
  All right, there we go.
  Might leave a little bit of a scar.
  Thanks, Alfred.
  All right.
  Oh, no, wh-where do you think you're going?  To the docks.
  I'm sure there's a manifest on the freighter.
  Whatever's in that crate must be important  if the thief was willing to steal it from the Penguin.
  I want to know what it is.
  Right, so being shot wasn't enough, was it?  You got to let this slide, Master B.
  There's more to this, Alfred.
  I can feel it.
  This is my chance to investigate a real crime,  stop it before it becomes something bigger.
  Fine.
  But just don't go charging around in broad daylight  with that bloody mask on.
 It'd be like having  a socking great bull's-eye on your back, all right?  So how do you suggest I get onto the ship?  There are other kinds of masks you can wear,  Master Bruce.
 As you can see, the scatter pattern  is tighter than most.
 You won't find  a superior weapon anywhere in Gotham.
  I'll take two dozen.
  Excellent.
  You can pay out front.
 Right this way, sir.
  Thank you, everyone, for coming.
  Tabitha planning on coming to work?  I am paying her half the profits.
  Don't you mean a third?  That depends.
  Where's my crate?  I ran into some trouble.
  - Did Penguin's men see you? - No.
  I wore a mask like you said.
  I know you're pissed.
  I'm not mad.
  I misjudged you.
  I was wrong to cut you in on my new business.
  You're clearly not ready.
  You're serious?  I can get the damn thing.
  I'll do it myself.
  But if you do want to redeem yourself,  you can do the floors.
  Mop's in the closet.
  Oh.
  You can mop your own damn floors.
 Another excellent night of business, Victor.
  Except for the part where a couple of thieves  - tried to rob your shipment.
 - What?!  Relax, boss.
  My men stopped them  before they could get their hands on anything.
  You see what I'm dealing with, Ed?    That shipment is full  of black market items I am auctioning off tonight  to Gotham's elite.
  I stand to make a killing.
  I cannot do that without the items.
  Where are they?  At the warehouse.
  Take me.
  I want to be sure it is all accounted for, and once I do,  bring everything back here for safekeeping.
  Okay.
        No.
 I don't know.
  Kind of opens up the room.
  Whoever did this, I want them found.
  I want them dead!  And I want Ed back here today!  Where are you, Ed?      Oh, he's up!  - He's up, he's up! - Where am I?  Who is how did I get here?  I brought you here.
 You're in my home.
 What?  I'm sorry.
  Who who are you?  You don't remember?  Hilltop Elementary?  Mrs.
 Macher's class?  I was third row closest to the window.
  Eddie, it's me, Myrtle Jenkins.
    Um, I followed your rise to becoming the Riddler.
  I've read every article, all the police reports.
  I guess you could say I'm your number one fan.
  Okay.
  Um, I'm I should get going.
  Whoop, that's gonna be tough.
      Why am I tied up?  You're not.
  Your muscles have atrophied from being on ice.
  Okay? But don't worry.
  These warming lamps should help thaw you out.
  Ice?  Yeah.
  - The last thing I remember - Yeah.
  was being frozen by the river.
  How long was I on ice?  Five months.
    I know.
  Since then, Penguin opened a club called the Iceberg Lounge.
  You were its centerpiece.
 That little freak.
  He put me on display like some caged animal.
  Yes.
  And I will nurse you back to health  so you can reclaim your throne  as Gotham's greatest villain!    Oop, ah, caveat.
  With me as your sidekick, of course.
    Doesn't that sound wonderful, my love?    You lost, kid?  My Uncle Al works on your ship.
  My aunt hasn't heard from him in a few days and she's worried.
  There are a few men below deck.
  I'm pretty damn sure none of their old ladies  are looking for them.
  Listen, I told my aunt I'd find him.
  Can I just take a quick look?  I'll be in and out in a few minutes, I promise.
  Sure.
 Go ahead.
  Thank you.
    You think you're real smart giving us the slip.
  - I don't know what you're talking about.
 - Ah, save it.
  Somebody tried to steal from this ship last night.
  Did this to my face.
  Tell me who you are working for.
  I assure you,  I'm just here looking for my uncle.
  I took a wrong turn.
  Sure.
 Here's a little advice.
  If you're gonna play the part of a street kid,  learn how to talk like one.
 Hey, Andy!  Get over here.
  What did I tell you about bothering me at work?  Sorry, fellas.
 You're right, though.
  The boy's acting does need some work, doesn't it?    You see, improvisation,  Master Bruce, is a very important weapon  in any actor's tool kit.
 There's a knife  being sold at your auction tonight.
  I was thinking you might be kind enough  to sell it to me ahead of time.
  Hmm.
  And why is this knife so important to you?  It's not.
  I have a client who's interested.
  Gave me a ton of cash, so I was hoping to get it  for a lower price and make a profit.
  That start with the attempted five-finger discount last night?  I have no idea what you're talking about.
  Of course you don't.
  I'll triple the opening price.
  It'll probably go for less at auction.
   My dear,  wherever you disappeared to these last few months  has not made you a better liar.
   It's clear that this  isn't about profit, but about your mysterious benefactor.
  He is your client, is-is he not?    Reveal his identity to me  and you have a deal.
   Wow.
  He's really got his hooks into you.
    See you tonight, I guess.
  Don't forget to bring your checkbook.
  Always a pleasure, Oswald.
 The knife was used to embalm King Balahsi.
  According to this, he ruled ancient Mesopotamia  for the first century.
  And what thief in Gotham would want a knife like that?  That's a good question.
  According to the manifest, the shipment was full of jewels  and expensive art, yet our thief  went for the item with the least intrinsic value.
  Well, that tells me she was a gun for hire.
  But who hired her?  I think I just found the answer.
  Alfred, look.
 This drawing  depicts a man being healed by water.
  Look at his eyes.
  His face.
  Who does that remind you of?  That's impossible.
  I mean, this-this drawing is 2,000 years old, Master  I know.
  That's him.
  That's Ra's al Ghul.
  He wants the knife.
  I struck out with Falcone.
 That right?  Try not to sound too happy about it.
  Look, if you brought back Falcone,  that would mean gang wars and blood in the streets.
  And I don't like it when the streets are bloody, Jim.
  Yeah.
 Well, see how you like it with Penguin.
  See you tomorrow, Harvey.
 Mind if I join you?  What are you doing here?  I figured you didn't know anyone in town.
  I thought I'd keep you company.
  Or maybe I just didn't want to drink alone.
  To my dad.
  I am sorry about your father.
  We may have had our differences over the years,  but I always respected him.
  Hmm.
  When I was a little girl,  if I wanted to spend time with my father,  he'd have me schedule an appointment.
  Save the respect, I know who my father is.
  Took him getting sick for us  to finally have a real relationship.
  How long have you lived down here?  Since I was 13.
  My father thought sending me away from Gotham  would keep me safe.
  I mean, there are worse places to grow up.
  People are happy here,  you see the sun every day.
  But I wasn't alone.
 I had Mario.
  We took care of each other.
  I know there's nothing I can say.
  I am sorry for what happened to him.
  You're right, there's nothing you can say.
  He was infected with the virus.
  You did what you had to do.
    There's no sign of Nygma anywhere in Gotham.
  Word on the street is, it was an inside job.
  Find whoever is in charge of hiring.
  Kill them.
  I want everyone here interrogated.
  There's a traitor amongst us.
 Those needles should help stimulate your muscles.
  You'll have feeling back in no time.
    Just call me the Riddlette.
 I know.
  What do you think?  I think that rehashing  someone else's idea isn't very original.
  Well, it's an homage,  and I thought you'd like it.
  It's very nice.
    Ah this is so much fun.
  If only I were the criminal mastermind you are,  we would have been together sooner.
  I'm sorry, I don't really follow that.
  Well, it took me months to plan your escape.
  I had to learn Penguin's schedule,  when he came and went,  devise an exit strategy.
  I'm sure it would have taken you two seconds  to think something up.
  It is slightly impressive  you were able to outwit Oswald.
  Though, as you said, my plan would have  taken much less time.
  Oh, wait, that is a great idea.
  You should tell me what your plan would have been,  because a window into your master villainy  would mean so much to me.
  I  Um   Oh, here I am bombarding you with silly questions.
  After everything you've been through,  you must be exhausted.
  Yes.
  - Yes, I must be exhausted.
 -   Ooh, soup's ready.
 Do you like tomato?  I put little question marks in it, too.
  Last one.
  One, two, three.
    Anything, my love?  No!  Acupuncture is therapeutic snake oil.
    I've been focused on repairing the wrong muscle.
  What?  Your brain.
  It fires synapses that carry neurons  to the rest of your body.
  And if we can stimulate it,  perhaps your other muscles will follow.
  - Logical.
 - Yeah.
  - What do you suggest? - Well  in anticipation of our partnership,  I have been working on a few riddles.
    Yes.
 Riddles.
  Yeah.
   That's exactly what I need.
  It's gonna make me feel like myself again.
  - Fire away.
 - Okay, here goes.
  What's black and white and red all over?  Easy.
 Zebra, with a gaping hole.
  - Next.
 - Um,  no, it's actually a newspaper.
  That's ridiculous.
  There's nothing red on a newspaper.
 Next.
  - Well, it makes sense if you know - Next!  Oh, um  I have a face and two hands,  but no arms or legs.
  - What am I? - Deformed baby.
  Come on.
 Surely you can do better than this.
  Uh, the answer is a clock.
 Hands  Oh, my.
  I think something is wrong with your brain, Ed.
  There is nothing  wrong with my brain.
  The problem is your riddles.
 Next time I'll know to pack a swimsuit.
 You actually own one?  Yeah, I got a nice two-piece.
  He comes with a sense of humor.
  Do you ever think about walking away from it all?  Gotham?  Sometimes.
  But I can't.
  Why not?  It's in my blood.
  My father spent his entire life  fighting for the city.
  Never took the easy way out.
  Neither can I.
  What?  Give 'em to me.
  I don't really think they're your size.
  Come on.
  - That, too? - Mm-hmm.
  - What are you doing? - Come on.
  You can't be serious.
  Just a little water, Jim.
  I can't remember the last time I just stood still.
  All right, Master Bruce,  let's go over the plan again.
  It's simple.
  I show up at the auction and buy the knife.
  Should be easy enough; I am a billionaire.
  And a very public one at that.
  Turning up at the Penguin's black market auction's  certainly going to raise a few eyebrows, isn't it?  You're the one that said that bidding on it  was the smarter play.
  That I did, but I didn't mean as going as yourself, did I?  What do think the idea was  of going down to the docks,  pretending to be someone else?  I was trying to teach you a lesson.
  Now, if you're going to continue down this vigilante path,  Master Bruce,  you've got to learn how to assume  other roles.
  Play the role  that you were born to play.
  That of a privileged, somewhat  pedantic teenager with deeper pockets  than anybody else in this city.
  You mean behave like a spoiled brat.
  It goes against everything that your beautiful parents  tried to ingrain in you.
  But yes  sir.
  Bruce Wayne  billionaire brat.
 $250,000 going once,  twice sold  to Mr.
 Bruce Wayne.
  Ha-ha! That's what I'm talkin' about.
  I love art.
  I love it, yeah!  I'm gonna put it in my, uh, in my bathroom.
 Steady on, Master Bruce.
  Let's not overplay our hand, shall we?  I must admit, this is fun.
  And try to exercise a modicum of financial restraint.
  Technically, you are the richest man  in the room, but let's not try and buy  absolutely everything, shall we?  True, but if I only bid on the knife  everyone's been trying to steal from Penguin,  it might draw his suspicion.
  If I go on a spending spree,  recklessly throwing my money around,  he won't think twice.
  Nice.
 When'd you think of that?  Improvisation, Alfred.
  It's a weapon in any actor's tool kit.
  Oh, heads up.
  Here we go.
  Oswald, my friend!  Bruce Wayne, what a lovely surprise.
  You certainly are getting out  quite a lot these days, aren't you?  The way I see it, everyone else in this town is having fun.
  - Why shouldn't I? - I agree!  You and your insanely large bank account  are more than welcome here.
    Barbara Kean.
  I thought she died.
  Unfortunately, nobody stays dead in this town.
  Excuse me.
  You do realize, don't you, Master Bruce,  that if you actually win,  Ra's al Ghul will come after the knife.
  Let him.
 The next item up for auction  is an embalming knife  from the tomb of King Balahsi of Sumeria.
  Opening bid will begin at $50,000.
 A hundred  thousand dollars.
  What does she want with it?  I have no idea.
  Stay focused.
  $100,000 to Ms.
 Kean.
  - Do I hear one - One hundred thousand  - and one dollar.
 -   Actually, Mr.
 Wayne, the bidding amounts are in $50,000  - $200,000.
 - Fine.
  We have $200,000.
  Two hundred thousand  and one dollar.
 Mr.
 Wayne.
  How about you let someone else have some fun?  Oh! Sure.
  No problem.
 I'm sorry about that.
  - $300,000.
 - Very well.
 Three hundred  $300,000 and one cent.
    $500,000.
  Now back off, you little brat.
  Wow, Ms.
 Kean.
  That's a lot of money.
  For someone like you.
 Two  Sold to Mr.
 Bruce Wayne.
  -  -     Congratulations, Bruce.
  Thank you.
 I do love seeing that woman lose.
  But a little piece of friendly advice.
  Barbara Kean does not give up easily.
  She'll be coming for that knife.
  I would just, uh, keep a close eye on it if I were you.
  Well, there's a new wrinkle, isn't it?  What's green and red and goes round and round?    Someone's obsessed with the color red.
   The answer, obviously, isn't newspaper.
  You're stalling.
   No.
  - You don't know the answer.
 - Of course I do.
  No, you don't, Ed.
    - Mm-hmm.
 - Your brilliant mind is as damaged  as the rest of your body.
  Actually,  my body is feeling fine.
  Frog in a blender.
 Selina?  Why are you sitting in the dark by yourself?  I was expecting someone else.
  - Like who? - Doesn't matter.
  What are you doing here?  Heard about Penguin's auction.
  So Barbara sent you for the knife.
  Figured, what, because we're friends, I'd just hand it over?  Something like that.
  - Why is it so important to her? - How should I know?  She was supposed to get it for some client.
  Said he was a pretty dangerous guy.
  And that if you were smart,  you'd hand it over and save yourself the trouble.
  So you're here to protect me, is that it?  The knife can't possibly mean that much to you, Bruce.
  I don't know.
  Like you said, I spent $2 million on it, I think I'll keep it.
  Why are you acting like this?  Me? What about you?  Are you really Barbara Kean's errand girl now?  I'm her partner.
  But if I don't give her this knife back,  she won't ever see me as an equal.
  So I'm asking you to do me a solid.
  I'm sorry, Selina.
  You should go.
    Morning, Harv.
  Jim, hey.
  This is Detective Harper.
  She just transferred over from the 3-5.
  - Jim Gordon.
 - Nice to meet you, Detective.
  - Heard a lot of good things.
 - From who?  It's good to have you in the fold, Harper.
  Thanks.
 Gordon.
  You got a visitor.
 Hot damn.
  Fox in the henhouse.
  No offense, Harper.
 None taken.
  But you got the wrong idiom, Captain.
  No, I don't.
  Be right back.
  Sofia.
  What are you doing here?  I came to help you.
  Oh, yeah? How's that?  Penguin.
  Oh, I know you didn't directly ask me,  but I find men tend to have trouble  seeing the simple solution even when it's presented to them.
  You shouldn't have come back here.
  Oh, Jim.
   I don't need your permission.
  Or my father's.
  I'm a Falcone.
  This city is my birthright.
  My father might not think I'm ready, but I am.
  Is that so?  What do you think I've been doing down south  the past ten years?  You knew you were coming back  from the moment I left your father's house.
  Everything that's happened was what?  You sizing me up?  No.
  Not everything.
  But I had to get to know you if we're gonna work together.
  We're not.
  Don't be sore, Jim.
  You came looking for a gangster, that's exactly what you found.
  We can do great things together, you and I.
  I'll be in touch.
 Some good it did.
  The ice broke his brain.
  What are you talking about?  What's green and red and goes round and round?  Frog in a blender.
  Exactly.
  Ed couldn't even get that.
  Hmm.
  It does seem unlike Ed to keep this rube alive.
 I want him found.
  And her?  A lot of people have been trying to steal from me lately.
  An example needs to be made.
  Have fun, Victor.
    Love your dress.
  Thank you.
  I made it.
  Hmm.
  -  -         Excellent technique, Barbara.
  I'm impressed.
  - I had a good teacher.
 -   I wish you'd have called ahead.
  -  -   Does that mean you don't have the knife?  No, Bruce Wayne has it.
  Bruce.
  Really?  How interesting.
  You're not angry?  No, not at all.
  You see, Barbara,  when I bathed you in the Lazarus Pit,  I did it in the knowledge that you would become  a competent ally of mine.
  And so far,  you've done an admirable job.
  I'm glad you feel that way.
  And I wouldn't worry about that knife.
  Didn't seem all that special to me.
  Oh, but you couldn't be more wrong.
  You see,  that knife is the key to everything.
  Well, not everything.
      

                



                


                    			1 Previously on Gotham  Jim, meet my daughter, Sofia.
  Do you ever think about walking away from it all?  Sometimes.
 This drawing depicts a man  being healed by water.
  That's Ra's al Ghul.
  He wants the knife.
 Opening bid will begin at $50,000.
  A hundred thousand dollars.
  $2 million!    Sold to Mr.
 I guess you could say  I'm your number one fan.
  What's black and white and red all over?  Zebra with a gaping hole.
  I think something is wrong with your brain, Ed.
 Gordon, you got a visitor.
  - You shouldn't have come back here.
 - I'm a Falcone.
  You came looking for a gangster; that's exactly what you found.
 That knife is the key  to everything.
  Well, not everything.
 Mmm  Beautiful.
  And you bought this at auction?  Supposedly, it was the embalming knife  of the first century Mesopotamian king.
  - Balahsi.
 - Ah.
  And what is it that you want of me, Mr.
 Wayne?  Anything you can tell me, Dr.
 Winthrop.
  I want to know exactly what it is I bought.
  Perhaps you should have considered that  before you dropped $2 million on it, shouldn't you?  Leave it with me overnight.
    I'm back.
 Man, you really need  to clean that room.
  My delightful grandson.
  I have access  to the very clean historical records room  at Gotham Central Library,  and he uses it for his homework.
  Oh, Alex, let me introduce you.
  Mr.
 Bruce Wayne and his guardian,  - Alfred Pennyworth.
 What's up?  Whoa.
  Where'd that come from?  That cuneiform is definitely pre-Phoenician.
 Alex is an avid student  of history, and sometimes assists me.
  A word, Master Bruce.
  Now, it's all very well  involving that old geezer, but a young man?  Just you remember who's after that knife.
 What's so important about it  that Ra's al Ghul wants it so badly? We need to know.
  Dr.
 Winthrop.
  Alex.
  I have to ask you to keep this matter between us.
  Of course.
  Yeah.
 Cool.
  I mean  yes, Mr.
 Wayne.
  I'll check back tomorrow.
  Until then.
  No!    Come on, Ed, come on.
  You can do it.
 This has to be  the perfect riddle.
 Yes.
  Yes.
  Yes! Yes!   You    Tomorrow night, Oswald,  is the night you die.
  Alex, bring me the Palmerian Codex.
  Ah.
  Ah.
  What is it?  he who rises from the waters,  whom death shall not touch.
  With this sacred blade,  his final savage destiny  shall be fulfilled.
  The earth will quake.
  Blood will flow.
  All tremble  before the Demon's Head.
  What's the Demon's Head?  Not what, my boy.
 Who.
  There is a legend in the time of this knife  of a man who could not die.
  Or who died but was reborn.
  Have you ever in your reading come across the name,  Ra's al Ghul?  He was a warlord.
  But those guys always had stories invented about them.
  They're just stories.
  My boy, people believe in these stories.
  They kill for them.
  I think Bruce Wayne has stumbled across  something much more complex than he imagined,  and infinitely more dangerous.
    No one should be here.
  Here.
 Take this into my office.
  Stay quiet.
  Quickly.
  Dr.
 Niles Winthrop.
 What a pleasure.
  Who are you?  Museum's closed.
  How did you get past the guard?  My apologies.
  But my business is pressing.
  Greek vase, second century.
  Oh.
    This was made by a forger in Marrakesh in the 15th century.
  He had some talent, but told the most obscene jokes.
  Tell me who you are, or I shall call the police.
  I'm looking for a knife  Bruce Wayne brought you earlier today.
  I don't know what you mean.
  Hmm.
 The best liar I ever met ran a brothel in Shanghai.
  Her quite considerable gift was that you knew  she was lying but didn't care,  you so badly wanted to believe her.
    You, Dr.
 Winthrop, are a terrible liar.
  Where's the knife?    Oh, the-the police, they're coming.
  I imagine they are.
 End of crime, my ass.
  Harper? Where's Bullock?  He asked me to fill in.
  He took a sabbatical for a few days.
  You babysitting me?  Do you need babysitting?  What do we got?  Dr.
 Niles Winthrop.
  Curator of antiquities.
  Looks like somebody snapped his neck.
  No witnesses, of course.
  Fire alarm triggered security.
  Maybe the dead guy pulled it right before the  Yeah, thanks.
 Anything else?  Yes, actually.
  According to Professor Von Dead's logbook,  the last person who visited him  I'm talking just yesterday afternoon  Bruce Wayne.
  It's all right.
 Let him in.
  Detective Gordon.
  What  What happened?  We were thinking we would ask you the same thing.
  You met with Dr.
 Winthrop just yesterday, correct?  I, um  I-I bought an old knife at auction.
  Dr.
 Winthrop agreed to examine it for me.
  I was coming by  to check on his progress.
  - When was he killed? - According to the fire alarm,  just past midnight.
  Whoever did it must have slipped past security.
  His grandson.
  Alex.
 He's my age, a little bit younger.
  - Have you talked to him? - No one's seen any kid.
  I'll get on it.
  Where's the knife?  Alfred was right I shouldn't have left it.
  Bruce, slow down.
  What's this knife?  You think someone would actually kill for it?  Detective Gordon, I'll tell you what you want to know,  but all I ask is that you let me come along.
  If this is because of the knife, then I'm responsible.
  Bruce, a man is dead.
  A child is potentially missing.
  This is not time to play detective.
  What do you know?  What's so special about this knife?  As far as I know, it's just an old knife.
 But  I paid a great deal for it, and there was another bidder,  a very aggressive one.
  Barbara Kean.
  Right.
  Well, Harper will track down the grandson.
  I'll deal with Barbara.
  You go home.
  I'll call you when I need you.
      You're here, finally.
  I've kept you waiting.
  Apologies.
  I see my guests have arrived.
  Oh, yeah.
  Got to say, they don't do much for the vibe of the place.
  If you had acquired the knife when I first requested it,  they wouldn't be necessary.
  What's so special about this knife, anyway?  Sentimental value?  Only a destiny born of blood and magic  2,000 years in the making.
  Uh-huh.
  Now Dog-Boy here is gonna fetch it    His name is Anubis.
      And yes.
    Bring me the knife.
  And you  can kill the boy.
    Boss.
  Knocking, Victor.
 We discussed this.
  Uh-huh.
  She's here.
  Show her in.
  Ms.
 Falcone,  welcome to Gotham.
  Mr.
 Cobblepot, it's a pleasure to meet you.
  Call me Oswald.
  Please, have a seat.
  Thank you  for coming to see me.
  I learned from my father,  when the king of Gotham summons you, you come.
  And how is Carmine?  Can we hope to see him sometime soon?  Shall we just address the elephant in the room?  By all means.
  My father's  illegal businesses hold no interest for me.
  I'm here because the Falcone family has a number of charities  that need my attention.
  And you can only provide that attention  by being here personally in my city.
  I understand your concern  Oh, do you?  But I assure you it's unfounded.
  You know, your father taught me many things.
  Among them was to nurture a healthy paranoia.
  For example, when I took over,  some of his old capos went underground.
  Now, perhaps they've vanished for good,  or perhaps they're waiting for a Falcone to return  to lead the rebellion.
  Uh Who knows?    But I hear your father's voice  whispering in my ear.
 Be careful.
  Now I need to know  that you are not on some fool's errand  to rebuild your father's empire.
 I'm gonna stab you.
  I was 13 when my father first sent me away.
  He said that Gotham was too dangerous.
  This is my home.
  I wanted to come home.
  That's why I'm here.
 Gotham.
  Mother to us all.
  I think we have nothing to worry about.
 Jim.
  What a lovely surprise.
  Barbara.
  I heard you popped up.
  Seems like you landed on your feet as usual.
  Hmm.
  A woman has to stay busy.
  You seem different.
  You like this me better?  You recently bid on a knife at auction.
  Hmm.
  So much for catching up.
  The knife is now missing and the person who had it is dead.
  What were you doing last night around midnight?  I was here with witnesses.
  We done?  No.
  And if you go chasing rabbits   This place, the money you used to bid on the knife.
  Who's bankrolling you?  A client.
  And no, though tempting,  I can't give you the name.
 Is it Ra's al Ghul?  Has given you the call   If it is Ra's al Ghul, you don't know who  you're dealing with.
  I don't know who or what you're talking about.
  Now, should I call my lawyer?  Feed your head   We'll be in touch.
  Come on.
  Feed your head.
   You followed me? After I told you to stay away?  What the hell were you thinking?  I told you I'm responsible.
  You should have let me come with you.
  It's clear she's lying!  I can help you find the killer, find Alex!  That's my job!  You want to help?  Who is Ra's al Ghul?  And why didn't you mention him before?  I wasn't certain he was involved,  but the way she talked  You're lying.
 Again.
  Ra's al Ghul is the real leader of the Court of Owls.
  He is the one responsible for the virus  and having me kidnapped.
    And you didn't think to mention any of this before?  Why would he want the knife, huh?  What's so important about it?  I have no clue.
  That's what I've been trying to find out.
    Yeah.
 Gordon, the kid's not at home.
  Apparently, Granddad was looking after him  while the parents were traveling.
  He's not at school.
 No one's seen him.
  Great.
 Listen, I need all the info you can get  on a man named Ra's al Ghul.
  He could be connected.
  Sure.
 But how do you spell?  No one's seen the boy.
  He's either hiding,  or the man who killed his grandfather has him.
  Police were triggered by a fire alarm at the museum.
  Alex could've pulled it, taken the knife.
  If so, he'd be hiding,  scared.
  Where could he be?  Think.
  I only met him for a second.
  You want to play detective? Now is your chance.
  What was he wearing? What did he say? Give me anything.
  He had on his school uniform.
  He just came from studying at  Gotham Central Library.
 His grandfather had a room there.
  Alex has a key.
  If he's hiding, he's made a choice not to trust the cops.
  If I show up, he might run.
  He needs to see a face he knows.
 Come on.
  Ed Nygma sent you?  The Edward Nygma?    Do it again.
    My once friend Oswald, now my foe   It's me, Ed, just so you know   It's time we meet, I think you'll agree   You'll find me where the Earth meets the sky   Where water flows and birds fly by   At dusk we'll meet, I'll see you there   We'll settle things, unless you're scared.
     What the hell was that?  We should torture 'em, just get 'em to tell us where Nygma is.
  No, he just found us on the street.
  Well, that's exactly what you would say.
  Leave!  That barmaid who kidnapped Ed said he'd lost a step.
  Clearly, she was mistaken, he's up to all of his old tricks.
  So, I'll meet him.
  You and your men will hide nearby.
  Attack when I say.
  Do not kill Ed, though!  I want Victor to freeze him again.
  - Huh? - Not you.
 The other Victor.
  Oh.
  Earth meets sky, water flows, birds fly.
  Obviously, he means the pier.
  Gather your men.
  I want Ed Nygma.
  Historical Records room?  In the back.
  Alex?  It's me, Bruce Wayne.
  You can come out.
 It's safe.
  Alex, please.
 I  I just want to help you.
  Alex, this is Detective Gordon.
  You can trust him.
  Okay.
 Okay, all right.
  I'm so sorry.
  That-that-that man, he killed him.
  - He killed my grandfather.
 - It was a man?  - You saw his face? - I only saw him  from behind.
 It was the knife.
  Did-did you know it was dangerous?  No.
  I had no idea.
  Alex, we need to get you down to the station.
  I-I-I can't.
 That man, he'll think I saw him.
  - He'll come after me.
 - I will protect you.
  - I promise.
 - He'll keep coming till he gets the knife.
  Alex, do you have the knife with you?  No.
 I hid it.
    Take Alex and meet me at the station.
 Go.
      - Who sent you? -   - Thanks for clearing that up.
 -     -  -   Bruce? Run!      - Bruce Wayne call in? - No.
 We released a citywide BOLO.
  What about that name I gave you?  Zip.
 Detective Gordon?  Ra's al Ghul.
  Minister of Antiquities attached to the consulate  of Nanda Parbat.
  Thanks for coming in.
  Nanda Parbat, that's in the Himalayas, right?  Well done, Detective.
  Few in your country have even heard of our tiny nation.
  Why don't we speak in my captain's office?  A bit more private.
 Of course.
  I'll be with you in a minute.
  Thank you.
  I don't get it.
 This is the guy that  you're looking at for murder? Why does he just walk in?  Barbara must have told him we were looking for him.
  - Yeah, but - Two thugs at the library.
  If they're working for him,  they would have told him that we've contacted Alex.
  He could think that Alex gave us the knife.
  I can use that.
  Call Alfred Pennyworth, see if he's heard from Bruce Wayne.
 Th-That thing bit me.
  - I need to get you to a hospital.
 - No, no.
  Then the police.
 Detective Gordon  No, I can't.
 I can't.
 They'll find me.
  I'm sorry.
  I'm scared.
    I don't know how you do it.
  You fought those men, and I  I just froze.
  Same as when that man killed my grandfather.
  Fear is normal.
  In the alley, when my parents were killed  I was terrified.
  I just stood there.
  There's nothing wrong with being afraid.
  Once you realize it's normal,  then you can put it in its place.
  Then you can act.
  Fight back.
    I felt bad for you.
  When that happened to your parents.
  You were all the kids at school talked about.
  What do they say?  That you live alone in a mansion.
  Don't go to school.
  Fly around in jets.
  They make you sound weird.
  Maybe I am.
  No.
  You're-you're cool.
  I'm weird.
  And you're a little weird, too, I guess,  but  you're weirdly cool.
    I'll take you to the knife.
  Can I get you anything?  Coffee?  That won't be necessary.
  I think you know why I'm here.
  Enlighten me, Minister.
  Barbara Kean,  with whom you spoke, was acting on behalf of my government  to procure a certain property.
  Said property is the cultural patrimony of my people.
  Why not bid on the knife yourself?  There were competing claims.
  And if we'd bid officially, alarms may have sound,  and so it seemed better to do it quietly.
  But  Ms.
 Kean failed.
  And now, regrettably,  I understand there's been a murder?  Dr.
 Niles Winthrop,  curator at the Gotham Natural History Museum.
  That's awful.
  But the reason I'm here, Detective,  is to press my claim on behalf of my government,  and entreat you to return the knife to me.
  You say this knife is important to your country,  please explain.
  Hmm.
  There is an ancient story amongst my people  of a man  who could not die.
  In his time, he committed terrible acts,  raised a great kingdom,  and then vanished.
  What happened to him?  If the legend is to be believed,  he walked away from his throne vowing that one day  he would return and complete his destiny,  but that would require a particular knife.
  This knife.
  A story, as I said.
  But to my people  very meaningful.
  I hope that satisfies your curiosity.
  Some.
  But you see, Minister,  my chief concern,  is there's a boy, the grandson of the curator.
  He's being hunted.
  Now, perhaps that's because of the knife.
  Or perhaps the killer thinks  he saw something.
  Did he?  No.
   Well, then he's safe.
  Yes, but you see,  I would have to know that for certain,  before I would do anything that might affect the case,  such as release the knife.
  May I see the knife, Detective?  It would so set my mind at ease.
  Hey.
 Gordon.
 Incoming.
  Gordon! Where the hell is Bruce?  You  Alfred!  - Wait, wait, wait! - Back off!  Take your hands off of me.
  You don't know what you got in there!  I'm starting to, but you are not helping.
  I need you to calm down.
  Let me finish talking to him.
 Gordon.
 - Not now.
  Gordon!  He's bloody vanished.
  He knows we don't have the knife.
  We have to find Bruce.
  Donna Falcone.
  Do not call me that.
  - You got to hear us out.
 - No, I don't.
  I didn't invite you here.
  We're not having this meeting.
  Now, I'm gonna ask you, please,  politely, to leave.
  We served your father for years.
  When Penguin took over, we had to go underground.
  Then we heard a Falcone  was back in Gotham.
  We knew it was time.
  Did you ignore my father like you're ignoring me?  I just told you to leave.
  Just tell us when your father's coming back  to put that Penguin in his place.
  Please understand me, my father is not coming back.
  This is Penguin's city.
  And I want you to leave before he finds out you're here  Too late, I'm afraid.
  Victor, how many graves did you dig?  Two.
  But they're roomy.
    -  - And there we are.
  My paranoia  is put to rest.
  Whew.
   You used me.
    You had me come to your club.
  You knew word would get out, that my father's loyalists  would find me.
  I was the worm on your hook.
  With one difference, my dear.
  The worm is usually eaten.
  So you trust me now?  You're alive, aren't you?  I would plant roses  they cover up the smell.
  My father wouldn't have killed those men.
  He would have invited me to his club, as you did,  but then gone further.
  He would have invited me to dinners.
  Had us seen in public.
  Sent the message that the old order supports me.
  And those men you killed would have pledged you loyalty.
  Now they're fertilizer.
  See, my father, he knew how to build on the strength of others.
   But it's your city.
  New times, new methods.
 There was an ancient Sumerian jewelry box here.
  I had just replaced it.
 Hiding in plain sight.
  Good thinking.
  Bruce, there's a legend about this knife.
  That terrible things happen because of it.
  But what if it's not just a legend?  My grandfather is dead.
  The man that killed him,  he can't have this.
  I won't let him.
  I promise.
 We have to get out of here.
  Run.
 Run.
                      The Nanda Parbat consulate's giving us the runaround,  and we can't get in there without a warrant.
  Bruce still hasn't called you?  No.
 No, no, no.
  You do not get to lecture me  about a lack of honesty and openness.
  You and Bruce have been up to something for weeks.
  What have you two gotten yourselves into?  Damn it, Alfred.
 I'm on your side.
  Well, that may be, mate, but whatever Master Bruce  decides to tell you is his decision, isn't it?  You are his guardian.
  You are allowed to violate his privacy  if it is gonna keep him out of danger.
  Stick to the point.
  What are you doing to find my boy?  What can I do? Huh?  I have every cop in the city on alert,  but as long as Ra's al Ghul thinks he has that knife,  - his life is in danger.
 - Yeah, right, and what about  the other boy? Did he tell you where he put the knife?  No.
 But I have to assume Bruce is taking him to get it.
  Right.
  Well, there's got to be a clue or something inside here.
  What?  - You stay here.
 - What?  The access I gave you depended on trust.
  If you can't be honest with me, there's nothing I can do.
  Harper.
  If Mr.
 Pennyworth tries to leave,  arrest him.
  On what charge?  She'll think of something.
      I went to the pier.
  I waited.
  Ed didn't show.
  He  Oh, just get on with it.
  Right.
  - One, two -  Ooh   -  I waited and waited  -   But you never came   You must be a coward   Or worse, a lamebrain   I'll give you one chance   To make it right   Meet me again, this time   At midnight   I'll make this one easy   This place makes some people lie   Some people speak   And some people cry.
   - Honestly, that could be anything.
 Can we please  just torture them now?  Why not?  W-Wait, man.
          Run.
    Bruce?  Down!    Let's go.
  Let's go.
  Take him.
 Take him, go!  -  - Aah!  - Get off of me! -                   It's time you tell me what's going on.
 Excellent question, Detective.
  And you shall have your answer soon.
  Just give me the knife, and I will release the boy.
  You'd like that, wouldn't you?  -  -   Of course.
  Bruce, hand me the knife.
  Bruce.
  Hand me the knife.
  You don't understand.
  He killed Alfred.
  And then brought him back to life.
  And Alex's grandfather was afraid of this knife.
  I can't give it to him.
  If we don't hand it over now, Alex is dead.
  - That is all that matters.
 - No!  You don't know who he is.
  I can't.
  Well done, Bruce.
  You're finally beginning to see things clearly.
  The question is    are you strong enough?   No!  Drop the weapon.
 Hands in the air.
 On your knees.
  Arrest me.
  Ra's al Ghul is on his way to Blackgate.
  And we made contact with Alex's parents.
  It's gonna take them a couple days to get home.
  Bruce  Ra's is a psychopath.
  You're not responsible for his actions.
  I want to help.
  But everything you've said so far  Alfred dying and coming back to life,  magical waters  Give me something I can believe.
  Perhaps now you understand why we held back.
  It doesn't matter what you say, Detective.
  This is all my fault.
  Alex is dead because of me.
  I killed him.
  Oswald!  I waited for you.
  Again.
  And you didn't show!  Again.
  You coward.
  Where are you?!  Here.
  And I may be many things,  but I am not a coward.
  Your riddles suck.
  This place may make some people lie,  some people speak, and some people cry.
  That could mean anything!  Lying, speaking, crying  You're just describing a range of human behavior!  No!  I meant lying,  as in lying d  laying dow lying down!  As in dead!  Oh.
  The answer was Stoker Cemetery.
  Clearly.
  Only an idiot wouldn't see that.
  Face it, Ed  You can't make riddles to save your ass anymore.
  I guess she was right.
  What? Who was right?  Your number one fan.
  She said that there was something wrong with you.
    Took me a while to believe it, but    you're not smart.
   I am too smart.
  I'm the Riddler.
  Oh, God, that name again? Tell me,  how long did it take you to come up with those riddles?  I don't know.
  A minute? Two minutes?  A few hours.
  Six hours.
  Six hours?  - Yes.
 - For two bad riddles?  Does that sound anything like the old you?  Well, perhaps I'm still recovering  from being frozen in a block of ice!  But revenge will certainly make me feel better.
  You'll never have revenge on me.
  Uh, yeah, I will.
  - Uh, no, you won't.
 - Oswald  I'm gonna shoot you.
    Yes.
  You might shoot me.
  Kill me.
  But only he can get revenge on me.
  The man I froze on that pier.
    The man who would've killed himself  before writing those idiotic riddles.
  The man whose name I still will not speak.
  But he's gone.
   You're just Ed Nygma.
  And not even Ed Nygma.
  Because Ed Nygma would've noticed something.
  What?  Doesn't it feel kind of chilly in here?  Oh!  You remember him?  My other Victor?  I'm going to put you on ice.
  Again.
  You want the same pose or something else?  No.
 Wait, please.
  Got it.
 Same pose.
  No!   Okay, Oswald.
  I'm not the Riddler.
  Do it.
  Stop.
  I've changed my mind.
  I'm not gonna freeze you.
  I would only be freezing  Ed Nygma.
 Who cares about that?  No.
  A better revenge is having you live,  knowing that you are not him,  and you never will be again.
  Good-bye, Ed.
 Who am I?  I must've been seven or eight.
  It was late.
  I snuck downstairs to find my father  with a man before him on his knees,  begging for forgiveness.
  My father stabbed him in his neck.
  The next morning there wasn't a trace of blood,  and we had breakfast at that table.
  Now, you'd think I'd want to stay far away from Gotham,  but this house,  this city, is in my veins.
  I'm home, Jim.
  The word on the street is three Falcone capos  - have gone missing.
 - Hmm.
  They were in hiding.
  Penguin used me as bait to draw them out.
  And kill them.
  And you let him?  Don't act the innocent, Jim.
  You came to Carmine Falcone for help.
  It was never gonna be bloodless.
  So is that your plan?  Get close to Penguin.
  Gain his confidence.
 What then?  I need to know what you're going to do.
  No.
  You don't.
  You want the city back from Penguin.
  I'll give that to you.
  But you have to trust me.
 Get ready.
 Prisoner walking.
 Guards, stay sharp!      

                



                


                    			1 - Previously on Gotham - Where are you, Ed?  What's green and red and goes round and round?  Zebra with a gaping hole.
  Your brilliant mind is as damaged as the rest of your body.
 I guess she was right.
  You're not smart!  We'd need an army to take on Penguin.
  Makes me miss Falcone.
 You came looking for a gangster.
 That's exactly what you found.
  I'm a Falcone.
  I need to know what you're going to do.
  You want the city back from Penguin,  I'll give that to you.
  Did you really think I wouldn't figure it out?  The two of you have been whispering  like teenagers for weeks.
 Yes, I killed him.
  I am sorry.
  There's a legend about this knife.
  The man that killed my grandfather can't have this.
  I promise.
  That's Ra's al Ghul.
 That knife is the key to everything.
  Give me the knife and I will release the boy.
  - Bruce, hand me the knife.
 - I can't.
 Ah, used to be a gangster.
  Name's, uh, Gilzean.
 Maybe Gold?  Took a slug in the noodle.
 Been in a coma six months.
  So, hospital brass wants to free up some beds?  Yeah, say take him upstate.
    Rest in peace, Butch Gilzean.
  Cyrus Gold.
   Whoever the hell you are.
        Hey, Harvey.
  Has anyone contacted you about Ra's al Ghul?  No.
  I just heard from Judge Bam Bam's clerk.
  - His trial got pushed off the docket.
 - And?  And I want to make sure him being minister  of a foreign country doesn't let him weasel out of this.
  He killed a boy.
  That's above my pay grade, pal.
  I just, uh, bust the bad guys.
  Do you?  These are release forms.
  Of my collars.
  Let me guess, each one of them has a license  from Penguin, right?  Jim, I am stuck between a rock and a hard place.
  Every mook you bust with a license, the commissioner  orders me to let him go.
 Gordon, got a call  from the judge's clerk; it's about Ra's al Ghul.
  Here.
  I'm doing my job.
  Master Bruce.
  No sleep?  Again?  Once more, about that boy's death  Don't say it's not my fault.
  It is my fault.
  Alex is dead because I hesitated.
  Well, perhaps you did,  but that doesn't make you his murderer, does it?  Ra's killed that innocent little boy,  and he's gonna pay for it.
  You really think locking him up in Blackgate will stop him?  He still wants this dagger.
  Stop going on about the bloody dagger, will you?  Just so we can just get some breakfast.
  - Please.
 - I think I finally found something  in Dr.
 Winthrop's notes.
  There's a description on the handle  that Dr.
 Winthrop was able to decipher.
  Says the knife is intended for the one  who has bathed in the healing waters.
  Right.
 Well, assuming that's not me,  that must be our boy Ra's.
  But that doesn't have to mean it's for him to use.
  Perhaps it's to be used against him.
  I see.
  No.
  You clearly don't.
  What you're suggesting is  that knife and that knife alone  is the only thing capable of doing him in.
  If Ra's al Ghul believes this knife will kill him,  that could explain why he wants it so badly.
  So he can destroy it.
  Before someone fulfills the prophecy.
  Master Bruce, I know that you feel bad about Alex.
  We all do.
  But at this point, you must remember your vow.
  No killing.
  No killing.
  Taking a life, never mind how justified,  will lead you down  a darker path than you could ever possibly imagine.
  I know.
 I've been down it.
  You understand me, Master Bruce?  I understand.
  Good.
  Let's get yourself ready.
  Chop, chop.
 Such a tragedy.
  He was only a child and always so lovely.
  A heinous crime  perpetrated against such an innocent boy.
 And his grandfather,  murdered just the day before.
 I know, I know.
 I'll just be a moment, Master Bruce.
  Diplomatic immunity?  You are joking, aren't you?  The Nanda Parbat embassy filed papers to have him extradited.
  Could happen this week.
  - That monster killed a child.
 - I know.
  I was there.
  Look I am telling you this as a courtesy.
  - Oh.
 - But the news will get out.
  When it does, I need you to watch Bruce.
  I'm worried about him.
  And you blame me?  You're his guardian, aren't you?  You're supposed to protect him,  and instead you've been placing him in harm's way.
 Oh, I see.
 So that's what rankles, is it?  Keeping you in the dark.
 Well, if I was you,  I'd focus on your own job, Detective,  which is keeping Ra's al Ghul behind bars, tucked up.
  Just keep the news away from Bruce as long as you can.
  On that, we agree, Detective.
  The boy's been through enough.
       Thank you for coming, Barbara.
  Hell of a chicken coop.
  So, what's the angle?  How about this?  Say the word,  we'll be home drinking Chianti by dinnertime.
  I think I'll decline.
  So why did you call me here?  To say good-bye.
  When I brought you back to life, I asked you to be  my eyes and ears in Gotham.
  You became so much more.
  Save it.
  What about everything you promised me?  Do as I ask and I will give you a gift beyond your imagining.
 What the hell was that?  You'll see.
  Good-bye, Barbara.
            -  Born on a Monday  -   Christened on a Tuesday   Married on a Wednesday   Took ill on Thursday   Grew worse on Friday   Died on Saturday   -  Buried on Sunday  - Sweet mother of Mary.
  Never seen nothing like him before.
  - He's white as a picket fence.
 -   Easy.
 We ain't gonna hurt you.
  What happened to your drawers, big fella?  -  - Easy.
 Solomon Grundy.
  -  Solomon Grundy  - Born  on Monday.
  Born on a Monday   Solomon Grundy   License compliance amongst the GCPD remains high.
  The program is an unmitigated success.
  Numbers, Mr.
 Penn.
  A-According to my tabulations,  86% of crime is accounted for under Pax Penguina.
  Which means that 14% of crime  happens outside of my licensing system!  Uh the numbers are very good, Mr.
 Cobblepot.
  Get Firefly.
 I want examples made!  Yes, that might help.
  But, then, if scorching a few idiots was all it took,  anyone could rule Gotham.
  Thank you for your insight, Miss Falcone.
  I don't recall summoning you.
  I came to see if you had lunch plans tomorrow.
 Perhaps you  overestimate the pleasure of your company.
  Oswald  you may think you have everything,  but there is one thing you don't have.
  The Falcone name.
  A name that once accounted  for all criminal activity in Gotham as in  one hundred percent.
  Now you're just rubbing it in.
  I propose we have lunch somewhere public.
  By doing so, you'll show Gotham that you have  the support of the Falcone family.
  And that should be enough to send  those outlying criminal elements  scurrying back under your umbrella.
  Mr.
 Penn, item number four on my to-do list.
  Kill Sofia Falcone.
  Add a question mark, will you?  Tomorrow it is.
  Come on, you people have pills for everything!  Insomnia, anxiety! You have to have something for me!  I don't know, a pill to reverse the effect  of having your brain frozen and unfrozen?  That's kind of specific.
    I will not be condescended to  by an idiot in a lab coat!  You're not even a doctor!  Okay, relax, man.
 Just tell me your symptoms.
  Fogginess of the mind.
  Decreased capacity to think ten steps ahead.
  Inability to solve riddles!  God.
  I have got to improve my brain function.
  I could take a pill or a vitamin.
  I'll even consider a natural remedy.
  I don't want to get your hopes up, but there is something.
  What? Tell me.
  A trial drug.
  It claims to boost your natural cognitive abilities.
  That's perfect.
 Where is this?  The sample drawer.
  What is it called?  Uh, Smartivia.
 Blue pills, diamond-shaped.
  Smartivia.
 Smartivia.
  I don't see them.
  Try towards the back.
  I don't see it.
  Ah, here it is.
  Ow!  Oh! God!    A fake gun?  Seriously?  Ow! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
 I just need to know.
  - Do these work? - No, dummy.
  They're sugar pills.
  And I'm calling the police.
      Go on, do it, do it          -  - Oh!  Butch.
  You know Grundy?  Butch  I have never had an issue with you.
  Barbara Kean she is the problem.
  You and Tabitha are innocent bystanders.
  Wow, you don't get much sun.
  No  Man talk too much.
    - Collins, deal with this, will you? - Yep.
  Gordon.
  Gordon.
  Bruce is gone.
  - What? - You've got to get me into Blackgate.
  What are you talking about?  When we got back from the wake, he said he was gonna go  straight to bed, but he must've snuck out between then and now.
  My concern is that he's taken the knife  and he's gonna try and kill Ra's al Ghul.
  You're serious?  Yes, I'm bloody serious.
  We've got to go to Blackgate now.
  And then you can tell me the many ways  I've failed the child, all right?  - Oh, I will.
 - Listen to me.
  The boy is on the verge of doing something  that there's no coming back from.
  He needs our help.
  Right.
  Let's go.
    Yeah, it's about time.
  Shift ended five minutes ago.
  Come on.
              You weak  foolish boy.
  You're still not ready.
    My name is Bruce Wayne.
  Stop him.
 Stop him.
  Master al Ghul.
  Take him below.
  What? What are you doing?  We got your call, but I checked the logs  - Bruce Wayne hasn't been here.
 - With all due respect,  I don't think he'd come as a regular visitor.
  He's a billionaire, after all.
  I think what Mr.
 Pennyworth is trying to say is  Bruce Wayne could have paid someone to get him in here.
  No offense.
  We just want to look around.
  Sure.
 Whatever you want.
  But you came all the way here for nothing.
  And we're gonna need your weapons.
  Standard procedure.
  Of course.
      - Finished? - That's absolutely it.
  Unless you want to check my undercrackers.
  This way.
 Undercrackers?    They're here.
          Sugar pills, my foot.
  That dream was horrible.
  Oh, God!  Oh, you're real.
   Oh  You know  Grundy?  What? No.
 No.
  No, who's Grundy?  Solomon Grundy.
  Born on Monday.
  Your hand! How  I'm sorry.
  What happened to you?  Grundy not know.
  Okay, let me get this straight.
  You don't remember  who you are  or how you got here?    I'm sorry.
  Grundy  I don't know you.
 Best of luck, though.
  Hope you get the skin thing figured out.
 Later.
    Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!  You know Grundy.
  You help Grundy.
  Be  Grundy  friend.
  I'm attempting to be civil  but I can't help you.
  Why?  I just can't, all right?  - Why? - Because  Why?!  Because I can't even help myself!  Ow.
  You don't know who you are.
  Well, that makes two of us.
  I used to be smart brilliant  and now that's gone.
  I can't even rob a pharmacy!  So you want me to help you?  I can't.
  Well, I am feeling a pit peckish.
  We are closed.
  Janos.
  Last I saw you was at my tenth birthday.
  You bought me ruby earrings.
  Said it would be a fitting gift  for the daughter of the king of Gotham.
  Sofia Falcone.
  I heard you had returned to Gotham.
  What can I do for you?  I was wondering how you were faring  under Penguin's rule.
  The Szabo family is quite content  under Oswald Cobblepot's licensing system.
  But even if we were not,  we would be wise enough not to say anything.
  Good.
 Because I've invited him  to your restaurant for lunch,  and I want it to be a lunch he'll never forget.
 Bruce.
 Where am I?  Beneath Blackgate Penitentiary.
  Alfred Pennyworth and Jim Gordon  are upstairs in the company,  unbeknownst to them, of my men.
  Let them go.
  They have nothing to do with this.
  Still playing the white knight, Bruce.
  You replaced the guards before I got here.
  I'm sure your friends can fend for themselves.
  You applied for diplomatic immunity,  knowing I'd hear about it  and come for you.
  I wanted the knife,  but not for the reason you think.
  It's been ages since I first held this dagger.
  It was given to me moments after I was bathed  in the Lazarus Pit.
  Submerged in the waters    suspended between  life and death,  I saw a vision of you  my heir.
  You're insane.
  I'm not your heir.
  I don't even understand what that means.
  It means that you are the only one  who can end my suffering.
  Please.
  You want me to kill you?  Set me free.
  Well, thanks for the snack, big guy.
  It's been an emotional day.
  I got to go.
  - No.
 - Oh.
  Not this again.
 Come on!  God I've told you, I'm better off on my own,  and you are, too.
 Hey, freak.
  Ha, I knew we'd find you.
  And it looks like you got a friend.
   I assure you,  we are not friends.
 Get 'em.
  Both of 'em.
  No! No!    Grundy!    -  - Hot hot!  Grundy friend, help!  Don't leave, no.
 Help.
 Help.
  Hot.
  Hot hot  -  -   Grundy friend not dumb.
  Grundy friend smart.
  Well, I guess  yeah, you're right.
  Water beats fire.
   That was smart.
 I can't breathe.
    Oswald.
 They said this is their best table.
  Interesting choice.
  Are you sure it's not too intimate?  The point was to get the word out  that the Falcones support me.
  Don't worry, people will talk.
  I chose this place  because I heard your mother was Hungarian.
  I thought you might like a taste of home.
  I can assure you, Oswald, I'm not here to poison you.
  Perhaps.
    The chef likes to go heavy on the paprika, doesn't he?    How is the food, otherwise?  Serviceable.
  Well, I'm stuffed.
  Thank you so much for meeting me, Miss Falcone.
 And thank you to your family for their support.
  You can't leave until you've tried the goulash.
  If it's anything like the chicken paprika,  - I'll pass.
 - It's the house specialty.
    My mother made goulash.
  Brought the recipe from Budapest.
  Handed down through her family for 300 years.
  I doubt this will hold a candle.
 Oswald?  Oswald?  It took me forever to find his mother's recipe.
  Did you follow it exactly?  I followed the recipe to a T.
  The little man didn't like?  Honestly, I don't know.
 How long have you worked here?  Two years, thereabouts.
  I was in Blackgate for a time.
  We must not have overlapped.
  Here? As a guard?  As a prisoner.
  Oh, yeah.
 Heard about that.
  Is there a reason why you're not taking us  through maximum security?  Prisoners are in the yard this time of day.
  Been some changes since you were here.
  McCloskey.
  That's funny.
  I know another J.
 McCloskey who works here.
  My cousin.
 Gets confusing sometimes.
  All right, let's go.
  - Through this door.
 I got to say, mate,  I really love what you've done with the old place.
  However, I've got a question for you.
  Yeah?  Where are the real guards?      Where is Bruce Wayne?  Ra's al Ghul has plans for the boy.
  Where is he?!   You'll never find him.
  Oh, you underestimate my resolve, pal.
  Well, at least we know Bruce is here.
  Well, we've walked the floor.
 Where could he be?  There's the yard,  the tower but they're too public.
  There's a sub-basement, accessible by the service elevator.
  Which way?        Who did I tell you specifically not to let in here?!  Uh, Miss Falcone is here to see you, sir.
  I'm sorry, Oswald.
  I'm not sure what upset you, but I  Enough!  Did you think I would really believe  this was all some coincidence?  That goulash tasted exactly like my mother used to make!  You can't fault me for the restaurant's authenticity.
  You're buttering me up.
  But for what?  Is it so hard to believe  that someone would want to do something nice for you?  There was only one person  in my whole life who ever did things for me  without wanting something in return.
  And that was my mother.
  Then I envy you.
  My father never helped anyone unless it benefited him.
  And eventually it drove away everyone who loved him.
  Go.
  I'll decide what to do with you later.
  Oswald, I only want to help you.
  Oh, you want to help? Try leaving.
    Your foot.
  It's just the weather.
    What are you doing?  - Don't.
 - It's okay.
  I won't judge.
  When I was a child, I broke my ankle  while playing with my cousins.
  I was desperate.
  Crying in pain.
  My father told me to put ice on it.
  Toughen up, stop with the tears.
  But my mother went with me to the hospital.
  And on the way, she told me  that cold actually increases the pain.
  What's needed is warmth.
  My mother.
  She used to sing.
 This may be hard for you to understand.
  But I have walked this earth for centuries.
  Waiting for you, Bruce.
  Only you can kill me.
  And only with that dagger.
  That is my curse.
  That is the meaning of my vision.
  I don't believe you.
  Believe me.
  This is just another manipulation.
  See.
  Look.
  My true form.
  Every moment of my life  is agony.
  End my suffering.
  Whatever your curse is,  you deserve it for what you've done.
  You're angry, Bruce.
 I understand.
  But unless you strike me down with that blade,  you will never be free.
  No!  I won't.
  Then allow me to tell you what will happen  if you don't kill me.
  I will disappear  and let you live your life.
  You will follow the path of light.
  Grow into a fine man.
  Become a husband.
  A father.
  There may be a day when you forget I ever existed.
  But then I will return.
  And I will kill everyone you love.
  Just as you watched your parents die,  just as you watched me slice your friend's throat,  I will slaughter your wife and children  before your very eyes,  and there will be nothing you can do about it.
    - Die.
 -     Yes.
 Attention, all inmates.
  The prison is on official lockdown.
    Are you going to arrest me?  For what?  For murder.
  I don't know what I just saw in there.
  But as far as I'm concerned,  Ra's al Ghul's men broke into Blackgate and he escaped.
  I betrayed myself and my parents' memory.
  I took a life.
  I did exactly what Ra's said I would.
  Just because you know you're capable of doing something  doesn't mean it has to happen again.
  Bruce, you and I have known each other a long time.
  Since the night your parents were murdered.
  Now, you may not feel like you're that kid anymore,  but I know that you are.
  One who believes in doing good.
  In fighting for what's right.
  Who will do anything to keep the people he loves safe.
  Nothing that happened today changes that.
  What are you doing?  You said it yourself.
  It's over.
  No.
  - Can't let you do that, Master Bruce.
 - Alfred.
  Listen, we started  this vigilante caper to prepare for Ra's' return, didn't we?  But it's become so much bigger than that.
  I see that now.
 I mean, I was wrong and you were right.
  You can make a difference.
  I'm not the hero Gotham needs.
  I made that decision the moment I killed Ra's al Ghul.
  I took the dark path.
  Yes, you did.
  And it's gonna be a long, bumpy journey back.
  But I believe in you, Master Bruce.
  I always have, and I I always will.
  Now, I understand that you don't feel worthy now.
  But when you do, this  this will be waiting for you.
  As will I, sir.
 Those guys that attacked us  didn't even have five bucks between 'em.
   We need a new plan.
  What?  Truth.
  Grundy friend  know Grundy?  You deserve to know.
  You and I  were the very best of friends.
  And then something happened to you.
  And I just didn't recognize you.
  But what is important is that, with your muscles,  we can make money.
  And with money, we can make me smart again.
  And then we'll figure out what happened to you.
  Just trust me.
 Okay?  Grundy, come on.
    So messed up, I want you here     In my room   I want you here   And now I wanna   -  Be your dog  - Yeah, come on!  Now I wanna   Be your dog   Now I wanna   Be your dog       What is this, a knitting circle? Let's see some blood!  Hey, I'm looking for the person in charge here.
  You're looking at her.
  What do you want, squirt?  Well, if there's money to be had,  we'd like to put our hat in the ring.
    And who are you?  I'm hey.
  I'm this fine gentleman's manager.
  Trust me, he's a monster.
  Well, more grist for the mill.
 Seven, eight  We'll get you patched up.
 Then we'll talk.
  Hey.
  Go get the doc.
  All right, one, two, three.
  Now I wanna   Hey, Doc.
  Cherry wants you to come look at some new guy.
 I'll be right there.
  Now I wanna   Be your dog   Well, come on       

                



                


                    			1 - Previously on Gotham - We will bust Penguin one day,  I promise you.
  Harvey, we cannot let this slide.
  You find someone with the license, they walk.
  Ms.
 Falcone, I need to know that you are not  on some fool's errand to rebuild your father's empire.
  An example needs to be made.
  the Falcone name.
 Was that your plan?  Get close to Penguin.
 Gain his confidence.
 I used to be smart, brilliant,  and now that's gone.
 Never seen nothing like him before.
 Solomon Grundy.
  You know Grundy?  We're the very best of friends.
 With your muscles, we can make money.
  - We'd like to put our hat in the ring.
 - Go get the doc.
 Come on!        Hey!      Good as new.
  Dr.
 Lee Thompkins.
  Oh my.
   Now, what is a girl like you doing in a place like this?  I heard a rumor you were frozen.
  Should've known it was too good to be true.
  Oh, you're not still mad at me, are you?  Mad at you for what?  Killing Kristen Kringle?  Or framing Jim for murder so he would be in prison  when I lost our child? No.
  I'm over all that.
  Let's be friends.
  I'm sensing sarcasm.
   Just as sharp as ever.
  Actually, funny that you mention that.
  Good-bye, Ed.
  - Wait.
 -   Holy hell.
  Butch Gilzean?  What have you done to him?  Nothing, believe it or not.
  And he goes by Grundy now.
  Hey, why don't you hang over there, big fella?  Make sure that wall doesn't wander off.
 Mm.
  I have no idea what happened to him,  but he's freakishly strong,  can't remember anything about his past life,  and he seems to love me, so, big improvement.
  But, I, on the other hand  I'm, uh I'm really hoping to get back to who I was.
  When I was on ice, my head got a little scrambled.
  Why should I care?  Okay, I came here with Grundy,  gonna fight, make some money to get me smart again.
  But you  Dr.
 Leslie Thompkins  you can fix me.
  You want me to fix you?  Oh, you really are dumb.
  Okay, okay.
  You're here for some reason.
  I don't pretend to know what that is, but  if you help me,  I will help you.
  I know you're not really smart right now,  so just try to understand this.
  I will never help you.
  - I was raised to be a gentleman.
 But you're also practical.
  We were seen at dinner, as we have been the past three nights.
  All of Gotham knows you have the support of the Falcone family.
  And I'm fairly certain no one's watching us now.
  I    I just I just like to know where I stand.
  This isn't easy for me.
  To have someone I can trust.
  A real friend.
  You can trust me.
  Let's have lunch tomorrow, just us.
  Till then.
      Have a nice dinner?  How long have you been here?  Long enough.
  It's time you tell me what you're planning.
  This again?  Ever since you've come to Gotham,  all you've done is make Oswald stronger.
  -  - It's time I know your end game.
  And if I refuse?  I'll put you on a train home.
  I want to make you a promise.
  In a matter of days,  I'll have Cobblepot in the palm of my hand.
  If I fail, I'll stay, I'll go,  whatever you want.
    Look, the count's good.
  Oh, now, go on.
 Get out of here.
  - I'll see you next month.
 - Yeah.
    Someone down there?          Freakin' cats.
 Oink.
 Oink.
  What the?     Hey.
  It really one of ours?  Seems so.
 He was in the uniform,  but the killer took his badge.
  No one recognizes him?  Well, that part we have not figured out yet.
  Let me show you.
    Good God.
  Freaky, huh?  Let's find out who this guy is.
    Here we go.
  Dave Metzger.
 You know him?  Seen him around.
  Not to speak ill of the dead, but he was a grade A bastard.
  - He have enemies on the force? - No.
 No cop would do this  to another cop, but he was the candyman.
  Penguin's bagman.
 He was the one delivering  payoffs to cops in the precinct.
  - I mean, that-that's the rumor.
 - Yeah.
  So someone killed him to send a message.
    - Where you going? - To see Penguin.
  Maybe he knows why someone wanted to kill his employee.
  Don't go stirring the pot!  Enjoy your lunch, Mr.
 Cobblepot.
  I need to talk to you.
  If it takes less than three minutes, I'm all ears.
  A cop was murdered last night.
  Dave Metzger?  A bagman on your payroll.
  Oh, and you think I might know something.
  Well, sadly, this is the first I'm hearing his name.
  A general does not need to know every foot soldier.
  You don't need to know him.
  I think someone is trying to send you a message.
  What sort of message?  The killer placed a severed pig's head over Metzger's own.
  Not a very clear message.
  Could have all sorts of meanings.
  Metzger may have been dirty, but he was still a cop.
  Someone killed him and is using his death to make a point.
  If that is in relation to you, I need to know.
    Jim, if someone had a problem with me,  I would know about it, and I would deal with it.
  I guess you're always one step ahead, Oswald.
  It's why I'm alive.
  But I would like to help.
  - Mr.
 Penn! - Right here, Mr.
 Cobblepot.
  Do we have anything that could assist Detective Gordon  in doing his job?  As a matter of fact, sir, a few days ago,  Mr.
 Wally Clarke applied for a burglary permit.
  The Pork Barrel.
  It's a butcher on Third Street.
  They specialize in offering  - the whole - Thanks for the lead.
  Enjoy your lunch, Oswald.
  -  - Don't thank me, Jim.
  Thank the licensing system you hate so much.
  Now, be sure to let me know if I need to get more involved.
  Till then, I'm rooting for you, Jim!            Ah, have a seat, Wally.
  You know how much trouble you're in? Huh?  You know what we do to cop killers?  - Just told him, I didn't kill nobody, -   specifically not no cop.
 What?! Are you crazy?  It's funny, because we searched the Dumpster  behind your apartment.
  Guess what we found.
 Whoa-ho!  Look at that.
 Porky don't have no head.
 Screw it!  I have enough.
 I don't need a confession.
  I'm charging you with the murder of Dave Metzger!  Wait! No.
 It wasn't me.
  It must have been the Prof.
  Who?  The Professor.
 That's what I called him  because he-he talked all fancy.
  He was the one who got me to rob the butcher's.
  We need a name, a description.
  We did it all over the phone.
 The whole deal.
  I-I dropped the heads under the Midtown Bridge.
  The money was there.
 I never met the guy,  never got no name.
  What do you mean, heads? As in more than one?  How many did this guy want?  It was there was four.
  You'd think he could've told me that he only needed the heads.
  But, no, I had to drag 'em to my house, chop the heads  Hey, shut up!  You know what this means?  Yeah.
 It means there's three more victims out there.
  How many bagmen did Penguin have on the GCPD?  Wild guess, I'd say four.
 The only one I knew was Metzger.
  Yeah, well, the people who got paid by those bagmen,  they'll know who they are.
  They're not gonna talk.
  We'll make 'em.
  Hey! Don't leave me back here with this thing!  Hey!      I found out   She's not coming.
  - What? - Sofia.
  Your lunch date.
  It's not a date.
  Whatever.
  She called.
  She's not coming.
  Did she say why?  Something came up.
 I don't know.
  I wasn't listening.
  -  And I knew  -  And I knew     It's just gonna go to waste.
  Only you   I want you to follow her.
 Find out who she's with.
  You think she's two-timing you?  She and I are not  Lover boy     This lunch was her idea.
  Now she cancels all of a sudden?  I want to know why.
  That's all.
  So attentive   Not like other guys   Now, Victor!    Today, we have ourselves a treat.
  Our beloved Hammer  will take on a new challenger.
  Just in from  Grundy come from swamp.
 Rules are simple.
 Last man standing wins.
 Grundy! Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!  Looks like I got a new cash cow.
  Take good care of him, Doc.
  And clean up what's left of Hammer.
 We're not looking to bust nobody.
  We just want the name of the bagman.
  Who delivers Penguin's money?  Don't know what you're talking about, man.
  - Wish I could help.
 - Oh, yeah?  Hey, hey.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Relax.
  I know a couple of other guys we can talk to  who aren't such douche nozzles.
 Seems like you should be looking  for whoever killed Dave Metzger,  instead of shaking down other cops.
  We're trying to save other cops.
  More lives are on the line here.
  Or you're using a cop getting killed  to go on a fishing expedition.
   Smells like I.
A.
 to me.
  Hey.
   Hold on! Hey, hey!  Just say you're not helping.
 We get it, okay?  Get off me.
 We're trying to stop cops from getting killed.
  How can none of you nitwits see that?  You're asking a cop to snitch on another cop.
  It ain't gonna happen.
  -  - Fine.
  We'll do it your way.
  Yeah, yeah.
    Come on.
 Geez!  -  -   - Gonna be a hot one today, huh? - Oh, yeah.
   It's got to be 90 out here.
  A lot hotter in there.
 Probably 100.
 Let me out, you bastards!  You know what, Jim, I think we forgot to get lunch.
  Think we got time?  I could go for a burger.
  All right, Culpepper!  We're gonna be back in a couple hours.
  Bullock! Let me out!  -  - I'm warning you!  Bullock! Bullock?  Bullock!  Okay!     Chris Whitlock.
  Makes deliveries for the West Side.
  - But don't say I told you.
 - Where can we find him?  He's supposed to be in court all day.
 My contact on the South Side said  their bagman's Jenny Butler.
 Trying to reach her.
 Good.
 I just want to find this guy Whitlock,  hope he gives us the last name.
  Should be getting out of court soon.
  You ever think you'd be running around,  trying to save cops on Penguin's payroll?  Bad cops.
 They deserve to be prosecuted  and stripped of their badges, not butchered.
 Call the police!     Hundred thousand people in a square mile,  and, of course, nobody saw nothing.
  Or is willing to admit it.
    Butler got off duty last night.
  Not seen since she clocked out.
00.
  Never showed.
  So, they were both abducted, taken somewhere, killed,  then brought to pose in front of this building.
  - Probably for us to find.
 - That's a hell of a lot of work.
  The killer believes his message is important.
  What, that he's got to rid the city of dirty cops?  Specifically, the ones who work for Penguin.
  No wonder these guys look on edge.
  Where are we on our fourth bagman?  - We need an I.
D.
 - I'm working on it.
      Good afternoon, sir.
  Sir.
  Detective James Gordon.
  GCPD.
  You been playing here all morning?  On and off, you know?  Guy's got to take a break every now and then.
  Yeah, sure.
  You see anything?  Anything out of the usual?  Sorry, uh, Detective,  I ain't seen nothing since the war.
  - Right.
 - Right.
  - All right.
 Have a good one.
 - Yeah.
       Aw, man.
  Aw, man.
 Really?  Let's try this again.
  Did you see anything?  An old van.
  Filippelli Plumbing on the side.
  Parked up the street a good part of the morning.
  Guy just sitting there.
  Guy? What'd he look like?  White dude.
  Didn't see his face.
  I took a break.
  I came back.
 The van was gone.
  All right, thanks.
  Keep the tip.
    What happened to you, Butch?  Grundy.
  Look at your hand.
  It grew back.
 How is that even possible?  Look at this.
  It's not even blood.
  It's like swamp water.
  Grundy from swamp.
  Yeah.
 I heard.
  You know, you don't even have a heartbeat.
  But you seem to be doing okay.
  You know,  Ed is not your friend.
  He's just using you.
  No.
  Ed Grundy friend.
  Ed Grundy best friend.
  He just wants you to fight so he can make money  and make his brain better again.
  Once he doesn't need you anymore,  he's just gonna discard you or kill you.
  If that's even possible.
  Do you understand?  Ed Grundy best friend.
 That's right.
  Best buddies.
  A-Team.
  -  - Ow.
  Not to mention,  your boss' biggest new attraction.
  Smells like we're sticking around for a while.
  Fabulous.
  Unless, of course,  you were to fix the broken connection in this noodle,  then we wouldn't have to stick around.
  We'd be  - Gone? That's the word you're looking for? - Yes, thank you.
  - Yeah.
 - Yeah.
  And, of course, I'd pay you.
   I'm patching up Grundy as long as Cherry tells me to.
  That's it.
  Keep your money.
 How's my best new fighter?  He gonna be ready to go again tonight, Doc?  Yeah, sure.
  I got to step out for a while.
 I'll be back.
  Just make sure you're here.
  We got a deal, you know?  Yeah.
 I know.
      Hi, everyone.
  I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
  I'll be right with you, okay?    All right, you can come on in.
  Okay, have a seat right there.
  I'll help you up.
 One, two, three, up.
 All right.
 Let's have a listen.
        Sofia Falcone.
 Yeah.
  All right.
 That was the mayor's office.
  Press has gotten wind.
 Things are gonna heat up fast.
  Then we catch him fast.
  All the cops who haven't called in.
  Hahn.
 Peterson.
  King.
 Nakajima.
 Messengale.
  Yeah.
 So, their precincts are already looking for them,  but I say we take this list to Penguin,  - have him point to a name.
 - No need.
  Nakajima's the bagman.
  How do you know?  Peterson and Messengale are both hard-core Bible-thumpers.
  That leaves three.
  And I've heard Nakajima's dirty.
  Units are already on the way to his apartment,  same as the others.
  I say we retrace his beat.
  Concentrate our resources.
 Jim, hold on.
  Doesn't something about this feel weird to you?  Whoever set the trap for Metzger knew where he'd be.
  And the killer also knew Butler and Whitlock's schedules.
  Are you saying it's one of our own?  Someone who's fed up with the corruption, decided to make a stand.
  But to kill them,  - display their bodies that way - I know,  brother, but it's something we at least have to consider.
  Which means anything that we say out there   Got a lead on the plumbing van your blind man saw.
  Spotted near the abandoned dairy on Commerce.
  Should I get the Strike Force?  No, Gordon and I'll cover it.
  If we need backup, I'll give you a call.
  And until then, don't say a word.
  And that's an order.
 You got it?  Let's go.
  Come on.
          Oink, oink  little piggy.
 So, it turns out Sofia broke her date with you  It was not a date!  to have lunch with the mayor.
  They went to Angelo's.
  She had the lobster ravioli; he had the tagliatelle.
  After they parted ways,  Sofia went to the old Gotham Heritage Hotel.
  I don't understand that place has been vacant for years.
  If I may? A couple months ago, I'd gotten word  a secret buyer had purchased the hotel at six percent  over asking.
  I think it's safe to assume that buyer was Ms.
 Falcone.
 When she got there,  she met with this clown.
  The zoning commissioner.
  She'd have to have had his approval  for the wall and gate she built.
    She's making alliances with politicians,  building a fortress.
  All the while she's pretending to be my friend  she's been planning a war.
        Victor, we will be having a chat with Ms.
 Falcone.
  Just so we're clear  is this a chat-chat or a  shovel-in-the-trunk  kind of chat?  Get the shovel.
      Mmm, mmm.
  I think I should rent an apartment  with all this money we're making.
  Do you have any openings in your building?  You know, Ed, what you should be doing with your winnings  is finding yourself a neurologist, which I am not.
  It has to be you.
 You know me, Lee.
  You know what this coconut's truly capable of.
  Which is why my answer is no.
  I know  about your clinic.
  I'm guessing that Cherry  lets you keep that as long as you work these fights.
  That's the deal that you have, right?  So?  So I'm guessing that that means something to you,  which makes you vulnerable to  to, um  to, um  Blackmail?  - Yes.
 - Threats?  Yes, both of those.
  All right, so, let's hear it.
  What's your brilliant scheme?  - What? - You said you wanted  to force me to help you.
  So what is your threat?  Hit me.
  If you don't help me,  I am going to  do something to that  - clinic.
 -   - Oh, my God, you really aren't smart.
 Jim.
 Nakajima?  Hang tight, buddy, we're gonna get you out of here.
      Grenade!  Run!  Harvey?  Harvey?  Detective James Gordon.
  I hope you don't mind if I say  I'm tickled pink to meet you!  I would shake your hand if it were possible.
  I'm a big fan.
  Big, big fan.
  Right.
 My biggest fan is a pig.
  Tell me where Harvey Bullock is.
 Oh.
  That dirty pig.
  Why do you waste your time with him? He's holding you back.
  Or can you not see that?  Oh.
 Never you fret.
  He's still alive.
  For the time being, anyway.
  But you, Detective, you  you are safe as safe can be.
  You a cop?    What?  What makes you think that?  The things you knew  the routes and schedules of the cops you killed.
  If  I were a policeman,  you could what?  Reason with me? Hmm?  Appeal to what we have in common?    Well, Jim  may I call you Jim?  Jim,  that's exactly what I was going to do.
  We have nothing in common.
  Oh.
  I beg to differ, mon frÃ¨re.
  You and I both see all too well  the corruption,  the filth  inside the GCPD.
  You and I know  that Gotham cannot survive  unless the cancer is cut out.
  We both share the same mission.
  Only I do it with a little bit more flair.
  Killing Penguin's bagmen won't change anything.
  But it will for them.
  It will quite a bit.
  But in the larger scope, you're right.
  Which is why  it doesn't stop there.
  Not until I've butchered every single swine  on Penguin's payroll.
  That could be half the department.
  I never said it would be pretty.
  Oh, it's the same old story.
  No one wants to see how the sausage is made,  but once it is made  Mmm.
  Isn't it delicious?  Bite?  You're delusional.
  You're not doing this for Gotham, you're doing it  for your own demented reasons.
  My reasons  are as real as they come, Jim.
  I have suffered profound loss  at the hands of the greedy pigs in power.
  Profound.
  Then tell me.
  Let me help make it right without all this.
 Jim!  Oops.
 Got to go.
 Jim, where are you?!  Never you fear, Detective.
  You and I,  we'll meet anon.
 Jim!  Backup's coming!  Harvey!  You heard Gordon, you freak.
  Backup's on the way.
 You got one chance to run.
  Lies from a liar.
  They would have been here by now.
  Besides, we both know, Captain Bullock,  - you deserve this.
 Harvey!  Ooh, I do hate to cut and run.
    - Oopsy-daisy.
 - Hold on, partner.
    Hold on, buddy.
 Hold on.
  You're gonna be all right.
  - Jim.
 - You're gonna be all right.
  - I promise you.
 -   You're gonna be all right.
  Hold on.
 Hold on, buddy.
  - Hold on, pal.
 -     I can't miss any more work.
  - They'll fire me.
 - It's okay.
  I'm gonna put you on strong antibiotics, okay?    Come on.
    Oswald.
  I didn't know you were coming over.
  I thought I'd surprise you.
  I'm sorry I had to cancel our lunch yesterday.
  It was unavoidable.
  You have to let me make it up to you.
  How about now?  I was actually on my way out.
  Oh.
 Hmm.
 Where to?  This is going to sound strange,  but I can't tell you.
  Not yet.
 I-I want it to be a surprise.
  The thing is  cat's out of the bag.
  I don't understand.
  I know what you're doing!  The old Heritage Hotel.
  The fortress from which you're going to attack me.
  What? No.
  Oh.
 Oh, so you weren't pretending to be my friend  while building your power base?    I should have known.
  But, you know,  your father's blood definitely runs through your veins.
  Luckily, not for long.
  Oswald, you're making a mistake.
  I'm your friend.
  We'll see, won't we?  Now, let's go see what you're building.
  I can't wait!    Barkeep, another grasshopper.
  Those won't help.
  - All right, give me your money.
 - What?  The money you made well, that he made  give it to me.
  I don't make any promises, but I'll see what I can do.
  Lee.
 Lee.
  I just got to know.
  Why did you change your mind?  Is it my charisma?  Close.
  You asked what I was doing in a place like this.
  I don't want to be here.
  I don't want to be anywhere near Gotham.
  I left.
  But I couldn't stay away  because of the Tetch virus.
  It hit the Narrows harder than anywhere else.
  So?  So? It was my fault.
  Jim tried to stop the virus and I didn't let him.
  I was infected, but nonetheless, I was there.
  I don't have a choice.
 I have to be here.
  Wow.
  If you wanted to blackmail me, by the way,  what you should have done was taken advantage  of Grundy being popular,  threatened to take him away,  and then Cherry, afraid of losing her star,  would have forced me to help you.
  Come by the clinic tomorrow.
  We'll get started.
  Hi, pretty lady.
  Ed's gonna be smart again.
  Ed's gonna be smart?  Ed's gonna be very smart.
  Hey.
  It's okay, Charlie.
  Oswald.
  I want you to know I forgive you.
 Uh, boss.
 What is this?  What's happening?   Kids.
  You started an orphanage?  I wanted to surprise you next week  when everything was finished.
 Children.
 Back inside, please!  Oswald, I want you to know  I understand the pressure you face.
  Your very survival depends on seeing everyone  as a potential threat.
  And I watched my father bear that weight for years.
  I don't want you to end up like him.
  Sofia, please forgive me.
  How can I?   When I've already forgiven you?  But you do owe me one thing.
  Anything.
  Lunch.
  How do you feel about mac and cheese?  I love it.
 Hey.
  Hey.
 You gave me quite the scare back there.
  How are you feeling?  I've had better days.
  Doc says you're gonna be okay.
  That shows what he knows.
  Pyg?  Son of a bitch.
  He could have killed me,  but he cut me just deep enough  to make you choose to go after him  or save my worthless hide.
  It wasn't a choice.
  Either way, I owe you.
  So pay it back now.
  Tell me the truth.
  How long you been taking money from Penguin?  You knew Metzger was the bagman.
  You knew Nakajima was dirty.
  The Pyg says all this stuff  about you deserving to be killed.
  I don't know why I didn't see it before.
  Maybe I didn't want to.
  I just need to know how long.
  We talking years?  No.
  Just since this license crap started.
  The commissioner ordered us to comply.
  Then Metzger started showing up  with these envelopes stuffed full of cash.
  I didn't do nothing I wouldn't have done anyway.
  You got to understand, Jim.
  The bills I got, the debts I got.
  It stops.
  It stops now.
 has the city on high alert.
  Gotham finds itself gripped by terror  at the hands of a ritualistic cop killer,  being called Professor Pyg.
  He is still at large after evading the police.
  The GCPD are urging people to remain calm  and to report any suspicious activity  to GCPD's Central Command.
 Two mother pigs  lived in a pen.
  They each had four piglets.
  And that made ten.
  All the piglets loved to play.
  And they rolled and they rolled in the mud, all day.
  At night,  with their mothers,  crawled up in a heap,  they screamed and they screamed  until they went  to sleep.
  And sleep well for tomorrow  the axe shall fall.
      

                



                


                    			1 Previously on Gotham  - Oink.
 Oink.
 A cop was murdered last night.
  A bagman on your payroll?  I think someone is trying to send you a message.
  Grenade!  We have unfinished business.
  Listen, if you think you're gonna  - Don't talk about my mother.
 -   An opportunity awaits you.
  With you and Barbara,  the three of us could give all those creeps  a run for their money.
 She's making alliances with politicians.
  Building a fortress.
  She's been planning a war.
  Oswald, I want you to know I forgive you.
 You started an orphanage?  I wanted to surprise you.
 If you don't kill me,  I will kill everyone you love.
    It doesn't stop  till I've butchered  every single swine  on Penguin's payroll.
  We both know, Captain Bullock, you deserve this.
  Hold on, buddy.
 How long you been taking money from Penguin?  You got to understand, Jim.
  - The debts I got - It stops now.
  Call dibs on my office?  - I ain't dead yet.
 - Just measuring  for when you are.
  Shouldn't you be resting?  - Let me help you.
 - I'm fine.
  Great, so we can talk  about you taking Penguin's money.
  I'm not that fine.
  I meant what I said, Harvey.
  This stops today.
 Hey, hey! - What the hell is that?  - You're trying to change the subject.
 - Obviously.
  But seriously, what the hell is that?    Some fancy-ass guy on the phone.
  How was I supposed to know what we were carrying?  Stench of death, for starters?  I got a cold.
  44 boxes  one for every cop in the precinct.
    Pyg's escalating.
  He's not just after dirty cops anymore.
  It's the whole GCPD.
  There are 45 cops here.
  Oh, yeah.
 Your support, I really appreciate it.
  Enjoy the, uh, benefit.
 As far as the foundation is concerned  Helping the needy.
  Very good for the soul, Master Bruce.
  I have to say I really appreciate  you allowing us to do the fund-raiser here.
  The Society meant a great deal to your father.
  As long as I don't have to leave the house.
  Well, you're Bruce Wayne, ain't you?  The world can come to you.
  Hey.
  - What the hell? - Excuse me?  - You knocked into me.
 - Bruce.
  - Sorry, I didn't notice.
 - Well, you should've.
  - Bruce.
 - Honestly.
 I'm really sorry.
    I haven't wanted to push, Master Bruce.
  I mean, what happened with Ra's  I know that you're hurting.
  Just, please, tell me  - what I can do to help.
 - You can get off my back.
  I'm sorry.
  I just  I can't stop thinking  about when I k  I should feel bad.
  Guilty.
 I  - I-I just - You're just angry.
  That anger  is concealing what's really going on.
  Unless you face it full-on,  it will consume you.
  And it will erupt.
  I know  what you're capable of.
  And I don't want to see you  or anybody else get hurt.
  I need some air.
  All right.
  Next time you see red stuff dripping from a package,  consider calling the police.
  We're C.
O.
D.
  Get the hell out of here.
  Hey, Jim.
 James!  I am so happy we are working hand in hand  to rid the city of this menace.
   He just showed up to, uh, offer his help.
  Did he?  Nice to meet you, Jim.
 I'm Headhunter.
  I'm sure you heard of me.
  My new security consultant.
  Recommended by Victor,  who is off visiting his bubbie.
  You want to know why I carry two pistols?  Overcompensation?   See, I always shoot twice.
  The first one does the job.
  Every time.
 But the second one, well  that's just my signature.
   He has a signature.
  Colorful, isn't he?  - Mm-hmm.
 - But effective.
  Mr.
 Headhunter and my men  will help the GCPD  until this Pyg situation is resolved.
  We don't want your help, or that of your idiot hit man.
  Pyg's actions threaten the both of us.
  He's killing  my cops, my employees.
  Allegedly.
  Get this through your head, Oswald.
  We don't work for you,  and we don't work with you.
  Ever.
    Well, your captain says otherwise.
  Excited to work with you, Jim.
  Are you out of your frickin' mind?  - Jim, listen - You are legitimizing him, Harvey.
  He's been legitimized for years.
 He was the freaking mayor!  Is it about the money? Is that it?  It's not about that.
  How can I know that?  How can you even know that?  Take a look out there, okay?  Half the precinct skipped town  because they didn't want to wear bacon-flavored death masks.
  We need the help.
  You are dangerously overreacting.
  I'm overreacting because every cop  in this precinct got a death threat.
  Except, of course,  - for you.
 - So, Penguin's guys  are gonna beat and torture their way through the city?  Then execute Pyg  - if they find him? - And?  And the people need to know  they don't need gangsters to keep them safe.
  I'll tell you what, I'm gonna find Pyg,  alive, and I'll bring him to justice.
  Good for you.
  Three cops just went missing.
  Where?  It's gonna be tough.
 It's the Narrows.
  So, that's it.
  We're shutting up shop.
  So long.
 Farewell.
 Toodle-oo.
  I can't believe this.
  I can.
  All this was so I could be Ra's eyes and ears in Gotham.
  He was bankrolling us,  and now he's gone.
 So I'm pulling the plug.
  Help yourself to whatever.
  So all of this being partners,  building something together  lies.
  A sales pitch.
  - I couldn't do it alone.
 - We can still spy  on the jerks who come in here and get intel on jobs.
  We can make it work.
  What? And the three of us stay together  like a plucky little family?  Well, how about a little parting lesson  from big sis.
  In this life, you're on your own.
  Always.
  never make Bellinis from a can.
  I followed a buyer from the Street Demonz.
  They have a chop shop across town,  and I saw exactly where they hide their stash.
  Let's hit it.
 Show her she's wrong.
  We're not gonna rip off  one of Gotham's biggest motorcycle gangs.
  Why not?  You and I will find something else.
        All right, PD here, Penguin's guys over there.
  Three missing officers.
 Patel from our precinct,  Fisoli and Perkov from the 2-2.
  Good Lord, there's blood all over.
  He got them here.
  Clear view from dozens of windows.
 Someone saw it.
  They sure did.
  All right, bring it in, everybody.
 Come on.
  the poorest of the poor,  the hardest of the hard.
  Now, I don't need to tell you  that they got a code of silence down here,  which means we got to make 'em more scared of us  than they are of their own people.
  We go floor by floor.
  Airmail!      - Let's get 'em! Move on out! -     This is gonna be fun.
  Hey! Hey!  Get off of him!  Get back.
    Hey! Hey!  Get off! Get off of him.
  They're potential witnesses.
 They're not perps.
  This is the Narrows, Gordon.
 You think there's a difference?  - Step away, Ruseckas.
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
  Ruseckas, they need you upstairs.
 You two, go.
 Now.
  Working out great.
  If it gets me my cop killer, yeah, it is.
  Right.
    Bruce?  I just wanted to say hi.
  I'm Grace.
 We went to school together.
  Grace Blomdhal.
  Yeah.
  Sorry I d  It's been years I didn't even recognize you.
  I heard you were homeschooling.
  Yeah.
  I, um  Why aren't you in school?  'Cause it's Saturday.
  I don't mean to knock your fund-raiser,  but is there any chance you're as bored as I am?  - You'd have to be pretty bored.
 -   So do you want to maybe go somewhere?  Yeah.
      May I?    Ma'am, please.
  I'm Detective Gordon.
  We didn't see nothin'.
  But you knew those missing cops.
  Or knew of 'em.
 Right?  Three officers, different precinct,  same patrol car they were freelancing.
  Look, I know how it is down here.
  A lot of bad stuff happens; half the time it's the cops doing it.
  They were running some sort of protection racket, am I right?  You sit over here.
 Yeah?  It gives you a pretty good view.
  So what'd you see?  Please, I need you to leave.
  No one's gonna know you told me anything.
  I give you my word.
  Can I help?  Get out of here.
  Now.
  Will do, Jim.
 Hey!  This is ridiculous.
 We're all on the same team.
      No, no, come on.
  Come on.
 Come, come yeah.
  If the old lady doesn't talk,  the old man gets it!  And after that, I go apartment by apartment  until I get an answer!  Drop it!  Back atcha, Jim.
  Oh!  Oh! Everybody stand down!  - I'm giving you three seconds.
 - I'm giving you two.
 He took them.
  He was driving a hearse.
 I didn't see the plate.
  It's all right.
  We don't need the plate.
  Just tell me which direction was he headed.
  Down 7th.
 Heading west.
  Hey, thanks, Jim.
  You know, I never really did the whole good-cop/bad-cop thing.
  It's quite effective.
    West on 7th that's Hoover Island.
  It's tiny there's only a couple of abandoned buildings.
  We can canvass the whole area in ten minutes.
  Yeah.
 And the second shot  well, that's just my signature.
  I know it doesn't look good,  but no one got hurt too bad.
 Empty.
  I got two in here!    This man is alive.
 Call an ambulance.
 Help me.
  - We will.
 We're here.
 Jim!  Pyg disappeared.
 There's no sign of the third cop anywhere.
  All right.
 Get some help.
  Hold on.
    My God.
  It's okay.
  As you can see behind me,  we just had a major police operation.
  A raid of some sort on this  Sofia, look!  Those are my men.
  And there's that Headhunter person I was talking about.
  Kind of a moron, but he is effective.
  at the scene.
 So, technically,  I saved that cop's life.
  Such great PR.
   Excuse me.
 Little person.
  Scoot.
      Is co-opting the police  not the most brilliant idea I have ever had?  It is Pax Penguina  taken to a whole other level.
  Hello?  Isn't it?  Oh.
 You don't need to know what I think.
  Well, now I definitely do.
    Ears.
  My father never would have  publicly aligned with the GCPD.
  They are incompetent and unreliable.
  Eventually, they will fail and fail big, and  you will fail with them.
  So  that's what I think.
  Thank you for your input.
  You're welcome, Oswald.
    Because you have shown me very clearly what not to do.
  In fact  I'm gonna get more involved.
  Personally.
  Don't ask for my opinion if you don't want to hear it.
 Okay.
 What the hell!  Someone broke in?  I was I was under the car.
  The stash is gone.
  Guy must've got out.
  So you must've messed up your only job.
  - Guess it's time to burn rubber.
 Hey.
  We scanned the entire area  still no sign of Pyg or Officer Patel.
  - You get anything off Fisoli? - No.
 No.
 I'll, uh  Wait, wait.
 He's coming to.
 I'll call you back.
  Officer Fisoli.
  It's okay.
 It's all right.
  You're on your way to Gotham General.
  You're safe.
 I'm Detective Gordon.
  - I know who you are.
 - You were taken by the Pyg.
  Did you happen to see his face?  Nah, he wore a mask.
  The others?  Perkov didn't make it.
  Patel's gone missing.
  - Do you remember anything? - I don't know, man.
  He was torturing us for hours.
  He was singing nursery rhymes talking crazy.
  Oh, geez.
   I watched him bleed out Perkov.
  - Did he say anything about Patel? - I don't know.
 I don't remember.
  Look at me.
  - Look what he did to me.
 - Okay,  all right, all right, all right.
  Let's take a break.
  Why is he doing this?  'Cause he's insane.
  But it's more than that.
   I guess he's just reached a breaking point.
  There's so much rot in Gotham.
  All of it, high to low.
  Sometimes even I feel like breaking, you know?  I was on Penguin's pad.
  Started off small stuff  deliveries and payoffs and then  it got bad.
  I get it.
  I've done bad stuff myself.
  For Penguin, even.
  But you and I can make it right.
  Once I get Pyg,  I'm gonna take down the Pax Penguina.
  And then I'm gonna go after the dirty cops, one by one.
  Now you have a chance  to make right what you've done wrong.
  Help me.
  Pyg is planning something.
  Nearby.
 He was  Maybe where he took Patel.
  He-he kept saying something about,  I'll bring justice to where there is,  uh, justice no more.
  Justice.
 A courthouse.
  There ain't no courthouse in the Narrows.
  There's one they abandoned a few years back.
  Pull it over!  - I'm getting out.
 - Yes, sir.
  - Thank you, Officer Fisoli.
 - Hey.
  You are one of the good ones, Jim.
      Hey, Brant.
  I ran into an old friend.
 Bruce Wayne.
  Bruce, this is Emma Hsueh and Tommy Elliott.
  You two know each other?  Oh, yeah.
 Last time I saw this guy, he punched me in the face.
  I should go.
 Hey, hold on, bro.
  I totally deserved it.
  If anything, you should've hit me harder.
  So true.
 He was such a jerk back then.
  Okay.
  Little heads-up, next time  you just bring some random kid to my place  - Parents' place, Brant.
 - He's so jealous.
  Brant wanted Grace all to himself.
    Whatever.
  Uh, you want a shot?  Maybe sample some party favors?  I'm good.
  Oh, I forgot about this guy.
 Total animal.
  So what do you do for fun?  I used to walk on rooftops and fight crime.
  Now I'm not so sure.
  Whoa! You're a bigger dork than I remember.
  Just kidding.
 Hey, whatever happened to that, uh, that,  that creepy old guy, the butler?  Is he still, uh, buttling?  Kidding.
  It's a joke.
   Seriously, does he buttle with you?  - Bruce! -   Stop! Oh, my God!  - Stop! -   So, does he buttle with you?  Brant, didn't you say you had a hookup at that club?  Yeah.
 Yeah, this is lame.
  Let's go.
  Brant's a tool, but this'll be fun.
    Whoa, there partner.
  You followed me?  Didn't have to.
  Your captain told me where you were headed.
    I guess he thought maybe you needed some help.
      Hi, Jim.
  Thanks for leading the way.
  We'll take it from here.
    Keep watching me like that and I'll think you don't trust me.
  Just give me my money so I can get out of here.
 Okay, I don't want to hear how I'm an idiot.
  I'm at the Demonz' place.
  It's, uh it's bad.
  - What? - I'm hiding, but  there are three of 'em,  - strapped.
 -   And they just called backup.
  You idiot.
  How about you yell at me after you come get me?  Just wait right there.
   I kind of have to.
  Selina's at the Demonz'.
 We got to get her.
  Isn't this what they call a teachable moment?  - Let her claw her way out.
 - We owe her.
  That is what her salary was for.
  Look, she only went there  to prove that we can make this work,  us running heists together.
  Oh.
 Then she might have considered not getting caught.
  She just wants a purpose.
  She wants a home.
  Mm.
 Then sucks for her.
  You know, I thought you'd changed.
  Like maybe you could think  about somebody other than yourself for once.
  Then sucks for you.
  It was my idea to offer my consulting services.
  And I daresay it has been a smashing success,  the Pax Penguina taken to the tactical level.
  And now we have reason to believe that the notorious Pyg is trapped  in the courthouse behind us.
  Look, I know it's a bit of a circus.
  But there was no way in hell I was gonna let you go  in there alone, all right? The Pyg ain't gonna go down easy.
  So I say we let Penguin's thugs go in first let them be  the cannon fodder instead of our guys.
  It's win-win.
  End of conversation.
    Yeah.
 Did you know I spell my name with a Y?  I didn't.
  You want to meet me somewhere, we can talk about it?  Please, Jim, I'm not that dumb.
  Anyway, P-Y-G.
  The Y is because it's short for Pygmalion.
  Like I'm creating a new, better Gotham.
  And I'm creating a new you, Jim.
  - Really? - Yes, except there's a slight hitch.
  I can't recreate you if you're, you know  dead.
  Which you will be if you go in there.
  In where?  Oh, don't act dumb.
  Only I get to do that.
  Let them play cops and robbers.
 It'll be fun.
  But not you.
 you are one of the good ones, Jim.
  Harper!  Call Gotham General.
 Find out  what the hell happened to Fisoli!  (Chant No.
 1 by Spandau Ballet playing)    Check again.
  - Jones.
 Brant Jones.
 - I heard you the first time.
  You said we could get in.
  Nope.
  Intangible crime   Stupid bouncer's acting like he doesn't know who I am.
  He knows who you are.
  He just doesn't care.
  I don't care how much money you have.
  You're a dork and a freak, Wayne.
  - You always were.
 - Brant, chill.
  I know this feeling's a lie   Give me a second, guys.
  I know this feeling's a lie   There's a guilt within my mind   - It's your fault for inviting him.
 - Shut up, Brant.
  Wait, who's Bruce talking to?  A lie   I know this feeling's a lie   Let's go, guys.
    Uh, not him.
  Let me talk to the owner.
  You're standing next to him.
  I bought the place.
  - You guys in or out? - In.
  I don't need this pressure on   I don't need this pressure on     Oh, I should question, not   Can't find either of them?  No, they're not standing over him anymore.
  They can't find the ambulance.
 Call it off!  Call off the raid.
  Fisoli's dead.
  The guy in the ambulance was the Pyg in disguise.
  - What the hell are you talking about? - Pyg called me.
  He warned me off.
 He used the same phrase  he used in the ambulance.
  He fed us the clue to get us here.
  It has to be a trap.
  So the insane serial killer who hates cops  warned you to save your life  - because why, now? - Because I'm against dirty cops.
  Except all of the times you are one.
  I'm telling you, Harvey, call it off.
  Call it off.
 I have another  interpretation, Jim.
 The Pyg is not trying to save you.
  He's trying to save himself by stopping the raid.
  You are being played.
  And not for the first time, I might add.
  We called Gotham General.
  They can't locate Fisoli or the ambulance.
  Jim, it's Gotham General.
 It's a madhouse down there.
  If I'm correct, the Pyg isn't even in the courthouse.
  I came directly from the ambulance.
  There is no way he beat me here.
  You're wrong! Pyg is in there, Jim!  He's right!  We got a spotter across the street  that got a visual on Pyg in there,  standing next to Patel tied to a chair.
  - I swear.
 - Look,  I can't explain it.
 All I know is, this is a trap.
  Now, you asked me to trust you.
  I am asking you to trust me.
  Ugh! It's so tiresome!  - Start the operation! - Let's go.
  -  - Jim, I'm sorry.
  I'm with Penguin on this one.
 We got to think about Patel.
  Let's move out, people!  You better pray I can clean up your mess on this one, Harvey.
 We've gone over the game plan, people.
  You know what to do.
 Let's go.
  - When's our guys coming? - How should I know? You called them.
 It's about time.
  Come on.
  Come on.
    I'll draw their fire.
  You see an opening, run.
  Screw that.
 Whatever we're doing, we're doing together.
  Well I guess now we see  if I taught you how to use that whip.
 Hello? Excuse me?  - Did you guys order Thai? - No.
  Good, 'cause I don't have any.
      - Nice shooting.
 - Obviously.
  Give me my cut.
  - Barbara.
 - I'm sorry.
  Did you want a hug?  I just killed five guys for you.
  Actually, we did it together.
  So that's it?  We're just over?  Over?  Think I came down here for kicks?  You're coming back to the nest.
  We got a shipment coming in  and a business to run.
  Well, come on.
      Hey!  Got him! Come on!  Harvey.
 Oh, no.
  Patel.
  Oh  Oh, no.
 The exits are blocked!  That's not our guns.
  They're pinned down.
  - Get in there.
 - Back up!  Mm-mm.
 Headhunter's hit!  Ruseckas! Harper!  Get Patel, now!  Shoot the chain!  -  - Get down!  Come on.
      I did not order the cops in there.
  I do not have that authority.
  I made a suggestion.
 Gordon.
 Gordon! -   How did you find the courage to run in  and save all of those people?  If the Pyg is watching  the GCPD is gonna take you down.
  And that was Detective James Gordon with a very modest,  if I may say, statement about  - his genuinely heroic - Thanks, Jim.
  - Way to go, Jim.
 - Thanks.
  They think Patel's gonna make it.
  Congratulations, Jim.
  You're a hero.
  And I'm just the cop  who shot a cop.
    This is Gordon.
  Wow.
  You were amazing.
  Oh, I was right about you.
  You are a get things done type, Jim Gordon.
  Oh, and those things that you want to get done  well they're the same things I want.
  Only if you want to go to prison for the rest of your life.
  Well, now that's just mean.
  I'm gonna find you.
  Oh, I hope you do.
  'Cause I want to thank you  in the flesh, flesh,  flesh.
    Because what you said about the rot in Gotham,  high to low so concisely phrased  well, gave me an idea.
  The next step in my plot.
  It's a saga.
  It's an epic.
 Ah.
  It's a spectacle.
  And you're my muse,  Jimmy Gordon.
  I'll see you soon.
    Oh, man.
    Well, I guess Gordon was right.
  You know, we should've     Second one's my signature.
    Dude.
 This is awesome.
  I always knew there was another side to you, Bruce Wayne.
  I think I'm gonna try it out for a while.
    If I was in World War II   They'd call me Spitfire   If I was in World War II they'd call me Spitfire   If I was in World War II   They'd call me Spitfire   If I was in World War II they'd call me   Spit   Fire   Fire   Fire     Thanks.
  That's from all of us, even if they're not saying it.
  Thank you, Detective.
 You'd have done the same.
  Yeah, but not as well.
 We got an unlicensed robbery.
 - I got a license.
  Like I told him, I just don't know where I put it.
  Oh wait.
 It's in my boot.
  Oh, we ain't accepting these no more.
      

                



                


                    			1 - Previously on Gotham - You can trust me.
 We don't work for you  - and we don't work with you.
 - Your captain  says otherwise.
 So, Penguin's guys are gonna beat and torture  their way through the city?  Get off of him.
  You better pray  I can clean up your mess on this one, Harvey.
  It has to be a trap.
 Oh, no, Patel.
 The Demonz.
  They have a chop shop across town.
  Let's hit it.
 We've got a business to run.
 I came here with Grundy.
  Make some money to get me smart again.
  Hey, I'm looking for the person in charge here.
  You're looking at her.
  Go get the doc.
  Fight!  Grundy fight now?  Yes! Grundy Ed's best friend.
  the Penguin!  [BOOING]  I'm so happy to be here.
  You love me.
 I knew you loved me.
  [BOOING CONTINUES]  You don't love me?  Get out of here.
  You don't love me?  You've asked for it.
  I'm going to sic my lackeys onto you.
  My hoods and the GCPD!  [BOOING]  Get 'em, boys.
  Get 'em!  You awful Penguin.
 You awful Penguin.
  You've got to do what I want  or they're gonna enter your homes  and terrorize your families.
  Get 'em! Get 'em!  [SIRENS WAILING]  You do what I say.
 Grundy.
 Grundy.
  [HORNS HONKING]  [ROARS]  - Let's see some blood! - Yeah!  No! You leave me alone, you monster.
 Birdbrain!  He'll never learn.
  You can't mess with the Narrows!  [CHEERING]  It is time  for the main event!  Get him, Grundy!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  A title defense.
  No refs.
  No rules.
  Mr.
 Murder Face.
  Yeah!  [BOOING]  And our champeen  Straight from the Slaughter Swamp,  it's Solomon Grundy.
  [CHEERING]  They really ate it up tonight.
  [LAUGHS] I think they hate Penguin almost as much as I do.
  You know what, I may or may not find a cure for you.
  At the rate you're going, may not have a chance.
  What does that mean?  You don't just have these people laughing.
  - You have them ready for a fight.
 - So?  So? So, what happens  when Penguin hears about all this?  Well, let that bird waddle in here.
  I have Grundy.
 I'm gonna be fine.
  And what about them? Your fans?  Not my problem.
  Ed, you've put yourself on the front line of something.
  - You can't just bail when fighting starts.
 - Okay, Doctor.
  If you would like to stop hiding from your past  and do some leading, you go right ahead.
  That's not what I'm here for.
  Well, then, case closed.
  Neither of us are willing to put our necks out.
 Hey, Butch.
 Hey, Butch.
 Stop hitting yourself.
  I love this.
  [CHEERING]  I love it! [LAUGHS]   Congratulations, Captain Gordon.
  A promotion.
  Harvey Bullock is captain of Gotham Central.
  Bullock's lost the rank and file, Jim.
  The debacle in the Narrows.
  Teaming up with Penguin's goons.
  Sending cops into the Pyg's trap.
  You know, he's  he's a disgrace.
  What does that make you?  Excuse me?  Last time I checked, you signed over  the entire GCPD to Penguin.
  Wholesale.
  What does he think of this?  Well, perhaps I've earned  that kind of cynicism, Jim,  but I want to assure you,  with hand on heart,  that this has nothing to do with Mr.
 Cobblepot.
  I won't take Harvey's job.
  Someone is going to.
  And, trust me,  none of our other candidates  share your misgivings about Penguin.
  [STAMMERS] Just take it with you.
  When you decide, all you have to do  is sign on the dotted line,  and you'll be the new captain  of Gotham Central.
 Nobody steals from the Demonz, Mr.
 Penguin.
  Why do I pony up for a license if some crook  can just swoop in and rip off our swag?  Your swag might as well have been  a lollipop in a baby's hand.
  You admit it.
 She admits it, Mr.
 Penguin.
 Oswald.
  What say we resolve this like professionals?  - The ladies and I will take out - [DOOR OPENS]  the rest of these so-called Demonz  and split their goods with you fifty-fifty.
  Uncivilized is what these girls are.
  Outside the bounds  of a proper criminal society.
  What?!  [GASPING]  Repeat that for my guests.
  Uh, Ed Nygma,  who-who owes his life to Mr.
 Cobblepot's mercy,  is repaying that generosity by aping his benefactor  in a crude commedia dell'arte.
  What?  He is making fun of me  in a clown show  in the Narrows!  [EXHALES SHARPLY]  [CHUCKLES]  [LAUGHING]  [LAUGHS]  Pretty funny.
  The Riddler's doing a Penguin act.
  That is not his name.
  His name is Ed.
  Plain, dumb Ed.
  And you don't know him,  so you don't get to laugh.
 Well  thank you, Oswald, for  clearing our account.
  Not cleared, Babs.
  The debt you owe him,  you now owe me.
  Of course.
 What'll it be?  Seeing as you love a good laugh,  I would like you to go to the Narrows  and see Ed's act for yourself.
  Then I would like you  to bundle him up  and bring him back to me by nightfall.
  - We're not your toadies.
 - [LAUGHS]  Dear child, what was that you said?  What do we get  if we bring you Nygma?  Very well.
 [LAUGHS]  In exchange, I will  not set every criminal in the city after you.
  I will not let them cut out your eyes  and feed 'em to you, along with your ears,  and then your noses, and then your tongues.
  That is what you get!  Acceptable?  Yes, Oswald.
  That is acceptable.
  - Well - Ladies.
  [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]  Mr.
 Penn will put you in contact with my Narrows informant.
  If those three do not have Ed in hand promptly,  you will go down there and burn them all to cinders.
 Trust me, it's a great idea  but far too messy to be practical.
 So, give me the scoop on this Cherry's joint.
 It's mainly crazy prize fights.
  Chain saw matches and stuff.
  But back in the day  we'd settle our beefs in the ring.
  Winner takes all.
  The code of the Narrows.
  Right.
 Well, I want to get in, grab Ed,  deliver him to his doom,  and then go find a martini.
  Okay?  Hello? Earth to Tabby.
  Sorry.
 Thinking about getting my hands on him.
  Yeah.
 As much as I hate doing Penguin's dirty work,  this job is like a little dream come true.
  Gonna be Ed's nightmare.
  Aren't we worried about him setting a trap, though?  He's a genius.
  Well, word is  Ed lost a step when Penguin put him on ice.
  But we should be ready for anything.
 You insist on persisting  in this misbehavior,  you leave me no choice  but to scold you.
  [AUDIENCE JEERING]  You've asked for it!  I'm going to sic  my lackeys upon you.
 Get 'em, boys.
  - [AUDIENCE JEERING] - Get 'em.
 Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!  Butch.
  It's Butch.
 Do you know what this means?  Yeah.
  It means you owe me an apology for electrocuting me.
  [CHEERING]  I got to find a way to go talk to him.
  Have fun.
  Tell him it was nothing personal when I shot him in the head.
  Wow.
  I have got to know what is up with this outfit.
 Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!  Could've sworn we had a job to do here.
  - Grundy! Grundy! Grundy! - Yeah, Grundy!  [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]  Morning, Harv.
  Where have you been?  Ah, sorry.
 Got stuck in traffic.
  What you got there?  It's the Bullethole Club today.
  These are the slugs they pulled  from the wounded cops in the Narrows raid.
  It was the Pyg that set the trap.
  But I was the one who sent those cops in.
  Yeah.
 You did.
  But now we got to move on.
  And we got to catch the Pyg  before he can hurt somebody else.
  - Yeah.
 - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]  Right.
  Captain Bullock.
 Detective.
  What's the word, Lucius?  The word is absence, as in  all of Professor Pyg's crime scenes demonstrate  a marked absence of useful physical evidence.
  How is that possible?  He's a loony.
  But a crafty one.
  We have to dig deeper,  try and get ahead of whatever he's planning.
  I'm at your disposal.
  Hey, Jim.
  Uh, about the Bullethole Club today.
  I'd really appreciate it  if you could be there, too.
  - It'd just help me a lot - Of course.
  I know you have my back, partner.
  Of course, Harv.
 I got your back.
 The Bullethole Club?  Cops shot in the line of duty.
  New members joining today.
  How's that work?  It's unofficial.
 Little ceremony at a bar.
  Commanding officer hands them the bullet they were shot with.
  This batch, cops wounded in Pyg's trap.
  And Harvey has to give 'em their bullets?  Yeah.
 Including the officer he shot.
  No wonder he wants a friend there.
  Yeah.
 No wonder.
  [CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY]  Leave it to Ed Nygma to find a way to turn his idiocy  into a tool for revenge.
  And everything was running so tidily.
  Now I have nothing but headaches.
  No one appreciates how hard it is to be a crime lord.
  I did actually spend my childhood being raised by one.
  My very point.
  In fact,  I thought we would have lunch together  and talk over the vagaries of this capricious calling.
  I'd love to help, but I have to see the caterer  for the orphanage fund-raiser.
  Of course.
  I can't expect you to be at my beck and call.
  [SIGHS]  You need a different source of relaxation, Oswald.
  Um  You need chickens.
  I'm sorry?  Do you remember my father's chickens?  [CLEARS THROAT] I seem to recall the don's  predilection for poultry.
  He understood that life couldn't just be about business.
  When his troubles were greatest, he spent time with his birds.
  You think I need  chickens?  An interest outside the business.
 Give it some thought.
  We'll talk about it when I get back.
  Chickens.
 [CHUCKLES]  Chick, chick, chickens.
 Boy!  Come here this instant.
  What do you think you're doing?  You cannot do things like that.
 Your enemies will know it was you.
 Butch.
  [EXHALES]  You're alive.
  Huh?  [PANTING]  Oh, Butch.
  What happened to you?  [GROWLS]  Eyeballs pop, accelerated blood beat, veins a-shakin'   Guess who.
  Psycho-killer stalker?  Got it in one.
  Please.
  If you were gonna pop, you'd have done it already.
  [GRUNTS]  Whew, that felt good.
  Been waiting a long time to do that.
  Other cheek?  I'm good, thanks.
  So what are you doing down here, Barbara?  This is a low-rent neighborhood for you.
  Yeah.
 If it wasn't for Penguin, you wouldn't catch me dead  - in a place like this.
 - Oh.
  You're working as Penguin's flunky.
  That suits you.
  Yes, and you seem to be thriving with your current life choices.
  We don't all make decisions based on what it can get us.
  There are other people in the world.
  Wow.
  Sexy and self-righteous.
  What does Jim think of this new you?  Jim who?  Yeah, but who but me could write this book of cruel?   Well, I have to go see a man about a kidnapping.
 But this  has been interesting.
  Toodles, poodle.
  Yeah, my whole world's breakin' loose   Yeah, my whole world's breakin'   All hell breaks loose.
   Kidnapping.
 Oh, crap.
 You play a great Penguin, mister.
  Yeah.
 Sure, sure.
 Thanks, kid.
  - [GRUNTS] - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]  Oh, crud.
  [THUD]  I thought you were supposed to be smart.
  Relax, Jim, no one followed me.
  I have Oswald wrapped around my finger.
  If you have such a good grip on him, explain that.
  Why would he want me promoted? What's his plan?  Oswald has nothing to do with this.
  The commissioner and the mayor can feel the winds changing,  and they want to be out ahead of it before it blows.
  It was you.
  You put them up to this.
  You must have made a hell of a contribution  to get the mayor to defy Penguin.
  No contribution necessary, Jim.
  Just the Falcone name and everything that it implies.
  Well, I won't do it.
  Not like this.
  And not at Harvey's expense.
  Harvey is weak.
  How much longer do you plan on propping him up?  And how many more cops need to die because of his incompetence?  I need to go.
  And you need to stop pretending like you're not taking that job.
  I'm not pretending.
  So you say, Jim,  but I don't see you rushing to throw that piece of paper  in the trash.
  Come see me tonight.
  After you take command.
  We will celebrate.
  [SCHOOL BELL RINGS]  Revenge is never as simple as a mere tit for a tat.
  Revenge must be specific in nature.
 Now,  when you imagine revenge against your two juvenile tormentors,  what do you see?  [CHUCKLES]  That might be a little overly ambitious.
  We must be crafty.
  For instance,  friendship can be an especially deadly tactic.
  How do you think you might use friendship to drive a wedge  between your two antagonists?  They're both flunking math.
  And you, I imagine, are very good at math?  Excellent.
  Tell me more.
    Psst.
  Psst.
 Hey, Martin!  Thank you.
 [CHUCKLES]  [BELL RINGS]  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]  [CRYING]  What's wrong, Martin?  Who did that to you?  Hey.
  Why you picking on Martin?  You like that dummy so much, go play with him.
  He's not a dummy!  Yes, he is.
 Well done.
  Feels good, does it not?  Minions are so much better than friends.
  But I'm your  The greatest friend I ever had  turned into my worst enemy.
  Shun friendship.
  You and I  we're more than friends.
  We're conspirators.
 Are you not gonna fight back?  [KIDS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]  Peekaboo.
  [MUFFLED SCREAMS]  Well, look at the little go-getter.
  Yeah.
 Well, you and Tabby decided to freak out,  so someone had to be the professional.
  [SCOFFS] Teenagers, Ed.
 Do you remember anything, Butch?  Do you remember anything about us?  Doesn't this mean anything to you?  [DOOR OPENS]  Ed!  Butch!  Tell zombie Butch to back off.
 Butch!  Ed is not your friend.
 Butch!  All right.
 Everybody just take it easy.
  Selina, what are you doing with these two?  Looking for trouble.
  Well, you found plenty of it, trying to take Ed.
  Let him go.
  You're such a bleeding heart, Lee.
  I thought you'd change, but turns out,  [CLICKS TONGUE] just got a new hairdo.
 Code of the Narrows.
  Code of the Narrows.
  Let's settle it in the ring.
  Champion against champion.
  The winner would take Ed.
 So your best fighter  against my fighter?  [SCOFFS] Yeah, let's do that.
  [SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE]  Honk-honk.
 Honk-honk.
  You Narrows trash  have been very, very naughty.
  You've been hiding someone from me.
  Don't listen to him.
  He's not my friend.
  No, Ed.
 No one's gonna save you.
 Ed.
 Grundy.
  No one can save you.
 Save me!  Oh, no.
 Help.
 [GAGGING]  Help.
 Help.
 Save me.
  [CHEERING]  [GRUNDY GROWLS]  Ladies and Grundy fans.
  [CHEERING]  Tonight is a special edition  of fight night.
  A good old Narrows grudge match.
  Winner takes  me.
 [LAUGHS]  And featuring your champeen  Solomon Grundy  versus  - Tabby - [BOOING]  the Tigress.
 [MIMICS CAT GROWLING]  Tabs, I know this was my idea, but  No, it's okay.
  Butch is still in there.
 I know he is.
  He loves me too much to hurt me.
  Grundy kill!  Babe, I love your faith,  but I really think you should take this.
  No.
 He won't hurt me.
  I'll just choke him out, no problem.
  [BELL RINGS]  [SNARLS]  Tabitha and Grundy were lovers  before he got this way.
  What if he goes easy on her?  Grundy will win.
  Not that it makes a difference, anyway.
  What does that mean?  The Penguin wants Ed.
  He's gonna get him.
  Come on, Butch.
  I know you could never forget me.
  You're still in there, I know it.
 Tabby, come on, Tabs.
 Come on, get up.
  Get up.
  Tabby, get up.
  [GRUNDY GROWLING]  [GRUNTS]  No.
 No, Butch.
 Oh!  [GROANS]  [GRUNTS]  Hey, Butch.
 Oh!  Butch?  [AUDIENCE BOOS]  No! No!  [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]  - I'll get you one more.
 - Yeah.
  I don't know what to tell you.
 Come on, buddy.
 You Detective Gordon?  Yeah.
  Harvey said as how I should give this to you.
  Said you'd know what to do with it.
  When was he here?  Uh, a couple hours ago.
  Before you all started coming in here.
  Thanks.
  [SIGHS]      [AUDIENCE SHOUTING]  Get up! Come on!  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING]  Come on, Butch.
 Come on, baby.
  Wake up.
 Come on, Butch.
  - Tabitha, we've got to go, now.
 - Come on, baby.
  Ladies, let's amscray.
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING]  - Come on.
 Come on.
 - I'll come back for you, Butch.
  [GROANS] What happened to the code of the Narrows?  Give me up, Bra-Bra.
  You're getting out of here empty-handed.
  [SCREAMING]  In the name of Penguin, everybody back the hell off.
  Well,  look at that cavalry.
 Not so fast.
  Boss gave you a deadline.
  You missed it.
  So what? We got Ed.
  We are literally champions here.
  What you are is four courses of barbecue.
  Crispy skin.
 Grundy, wake up.
 - [GASPS]  - Grundy! - [INHALES]  Get up, big guy, come on.
 Come on, Bridgit.
  Don't do this.
 You're from the Narrows.
  Yeah.
 And I couldn't be happier to be out.
  Penguin's right about this place.
  It's a sewer.
  Only way to kill the stink  is to burn it.
 Hey, Firefly.
  You're the only thing that stinks around here.
  [LAUGHS]  [GROANS]  You know what you've done?  Firefly's Penguin's enforcer.
  And who's the one who got Firefly down here, Cherry?  She informed on Ed to Penguin.
 You're a snitch, Cherry.
 - Shut up.
  You're over.
 It's done.
 Shut up.
  This is my club.
 It's my turf.
  You guys just do as you're told like the scum you are.
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING]  They're the ones that are the problem.
  They work for Penguin.
 Oh!  [AUDIENCE MURMURING]  I would like to announce  that we just quit working for Penguin.
  [CHEERING]  [WHOOPING]  Yeah! Do it!  God, they sure love  their cold-blooded murder down here, huh?  Yeah, well, we better split  before they decide they want more.
  - Hey.
 - [GRUNTS]  It's okay, big guy.
  Fire lady she can't hurt you.
  Ah.
 Grundy safe.
  [AUDIENCE SHOUTING AND CHEERING]  [SIREN WAILS, CAR HORN TOOTS]  [DISTANT CHATTER]  Where were you, Harvey?  Hey, Jim.
  I was just having a  little drinky-poo.
  Why don't you join me?  Not right now.
  Come on, Jim.
 Don't be like that.
  Come on, sit down and have a drink with me.
  [SIGHS]  Those cops were waiting for you.
  Yeah, to spit in my face.
  If that's what they wanted to do,  you owed it to them to be there,  to stand in front of 'em,  look each one in the eye.
  If you'd have done that  maybe you could have gotten their respect.
  I don't deserve their respect.
  Jim, I shot Officer Patel.
  What the hell was I supposed to do?  Stand in front of her and hand her the bullet  that I shot her with, that came from my gun?  That's the job.
  Take responsibility for what happens  to your cops that's the job.
  Oh.
  So now  you're telling me what the job is?  Yeah.
  Well, today, Jim  I just couldn't do the job.
  [SNIFFLES]  So I sent you  because I knew  you could.
  It's not good enough.
  - Not today.
 - [LIQUID POURING]  They needed you there.
  Well  ain't nothing I can do about it now.
  [GLASS TAPS ONTO DESK]  You got a pen?  For what?  [PAPER CRINKLING]  Harvey Bullock, you are relieved of duty.
  As of this moment, I'm assuming the captaincy of Gotham Central.
  Well, well.
  Look who finally got what he always wanted.
  But what I'm wondering is,  what did you have to do to get it?  All I did was my job, same as you.
  Nothing in Gotham is free  Captain Gordon.
  You just better hope you can pay up when your bill's due.
  And it'll come due.
  [DISTANT HORN HONKING]  Huh? Now you try.
  Uh  Ah.
 You've met Martin, I see.
  Shh.
 He's practicing.
  No.
 It's up.
  Upward, Martin, so that way you drive  the blade under the ribs and into the heart.
  Oswald?  Entirely theoretically speaking, of course.
  [KNOCKING]  Mr.
 Penn?  Urgent matters, Mr.
 Cobblepot.
  It seems that Ms.
 Kean and her associates have failed  to retrieve Mr.
 Nygma.
  Did you dispatch Firefly?  I did.
  And Ms.
 Firefly was herself, in turn, disabled.
  What?!  There's more.
  Yes?!  The mayor,  at his own discretion, has seen fit  to promote Detective Gordon to the rank of captain.
  [SIGHS]  That is  [CLEARS THROAT]  That is quite a lot  to go awry in one day.
  Very good, Mr.
 Cobblepot.
 You see, Oswald?  Business is not the end-all of life.
  There are other rewards to be had.
  Companionship, peace of mind.
  Friendship.
  Oh, I have to get back to the estate.
  I still have so much to do for the fund-raiser.
  Will you be joining me later for dinner?  I think not.
  Martin needs some more practice.
  Okay.
  Martin,  remind me.
  What did we learn today?  What did we learn about friendship?  Exactly.
 Sometimes,  if you're not very careful,  friendship can blind you  to what is staring you right in the face.
  [DOOR CLOSES]  Hey, Firefly.
  You're the only thing that stinks around here.
  I get melodramatic under pressure.
  How you feeling, big fella?  - Grundy confused.
 - Yeah.
  Tell me about it.
  What's with them?  They're, uh  They're acknowledging their new leader.
  Well, like I said, they love you.
  Uh, Lee, I'm supposed to be the stupid one.
  You heal their children.
  You stitch up their warriors.
  You've slain a fire-breathing monster,  and you helped topple the queen.
  This is your turf now.
  No, no, no, no, no, I am not a leader.
  Okay, well, if you don't do it,  somebody else will, probably worse than Cherry.
 Where do I start?  I don't know.
 Just  make 'em happy, give 'em something to cheer for.
  Drinks on the house.
  [CHEERING AND WHOOPING]  Good move.
 Why, Captain Gordon,  you came to celebrate after all.
  I'm not here to celebrate.
  What's wrong? I made you captain, didn't I?  You made me?  Is that what you think?  Jim.
  You can toy with Penguin all you want,  but I am not your puppet.
  No, you're not.
  You're my partner.
  Your partner?  I just stuck a knife in my partner's back.
  A mercy killing if you ask me.
  Grow up.
 You wanted  a gangster to help you get rid of Penguin.
  This is what that help looks like.
  Harvey.
 had to go.
  I don't need your help anymore.
  I think it's time you left Gotham.
  I'm not going anywhere, Jim.
  I came to restore the Falcone name,  and that's exactly what I'm going to do.
  So, do you want to come in and celebrate Captain?  Think I'll stay out here where I can breathe.
      

                



                


 Taking a life will lead you down a darker path  than you can ever imagine.
  I know.
 I've been down it.
  I'm not the hero Gotham needs.
 And it's gonna be a long, bumpy journey back.
 You've met Martin, I see.
  You and I, we're more than friends.
  We're conspirators.
    Got him!  Oh, oh, no.
 You are relieved of duty, Harvey Bullock.
  As of this moment, I'm assuming the captaincy of Gotham Central.
 Gotham finds itself in the hands  of a ritualistic cop killer, being called Professor Pyg.
 It doesn't stop until I've butchered every single  swine on Penguin's payroll.
  I'm gonna find you.
  I hope you do.
  It's a spectacle.
  And you're my muse, Jimmy Gordon.
  My poor lost lambs.
  I come to you today with an offer for this evening.
  Fresh biscuits and a hearty bowl of soup.
  - Wait.
 - Mm.
  I have place settings for six.
  Nobody wants some fresh pumpkin pie?  Smile.
  the Haves and the Have Nots.
  I know what it is to feel like a Have Not.
  But  I say, enough.
  - Here's to giving the Haves -   a taste of what it is like to be  a Have Not.
    Let's begin.
  Shall we?     I'll be out of your way in just a second, Captain.
  Harvey, this isn't how I wanted things to go down.
  And yet, here we are.
  You know what I was thinking about today?  Our first case.
  When I told you to walk Penguin to the end of the pier,  put a bullet in his head,  and dump him in the water, and you wouldn't.
  You thought it was wrong.
  It was.
  Well, maybe if you would've done it,  Falcone would still be running things,  and a lot of people who are dead would be alive today.
  If I could go back, I'd do the same thing.
  Because you still don't understand  how this city works, Jim.
  You want to be a hero.
  And Gotham doesn't need heroes.
  It needs people who will do what is necessary.
  You're wrong.
  If you show 'em the way, the people will follow.
  Guess we'll just have to wait and see, huh?  When your leave is up,  there'll be a desk here waiting for you.
  Sit around and watch you all day?  No, thanks.
 Right there is perfect.
 Thank you.
  Beautiful.
  I predict this evening's fundraiser  - will be a smashing success.
 - If I want Gotham's  wealthiest families to support the orphanage,  things have to be perfect.
  I appreciate you taking part, Oswald.
  Yes.
  Sadly, a situation has arisen.
  No.
  That thing in the Narrows,  with your former chief of staff?  No, no.
 This is far more serious.
  It has to do with Mayor Burke promoting James Gordon  to captain of the GCPD.
  You're not really worried about James Gordon?  Please.
  The issue is the person who ordered his appointment.
  - I see.
 - Do you?  Oswald, we both know the mayor is a weasel.
  Someone must have paid him off.
  But I don't see why that means you can't attend my dinner.
  Because, my dear, the mayor has vanished.
  But I will find him,  I will learn the name of my enemy,  and there will be a reckoning.
  And that is why I might not be able to make it this evening.
  Very well.
  But a few of the children are doing a song.
  Martin is taking part.
  It would mean the world to him if you could come.
  Of course.
  Now, don't let me keep you.
  If you think she's the one, we could have Victor  talk to her?  You do realize she is literally my only friend.
  I need the mayor.
 I need proof.
  But, sir, what if Ms.
 Falcone not to say it is her  has seen to it that the mayor is missing, well, permanently?  I could be chasing a ghost while she prepares her next move.
   I wish I had a spy,  close to her, someone quiet.
  Bring me Martin.
  Who?  The boy with the pad around his neck.
  The one who can't talk.
      I thought I was clear.
 We're done.
 Penguin suspects something.
  What are you talking about?  He was just here, saying that he couldn't come  to the party I'm having tonight for the orphanage.
  He knows someone paid the mayor to make you captain.
  I think he suspects me.
  - Have you warned the mayor? - I'm not a fool, Jim.
  I had him leave town after your appointment.
  Sounds like you have your bases covered, as usual.
  Thanks for the heads-up about Penguin.
  Don't call me again.
      This is Harper.
  Gordon, line one.
  Says it's private.
    Sofia.
 Wrong.
 Try again.
  - You son of a bitch.
 - Yeah, attaboy, Jim.
  Or should I say Captain?  Congratulations, by the way.
  So, do you remember when you said  the rot in Gotham went from high to low?  You've hit the nail on the head.
  Police were low.
  Now it's time for Gotham's elite to feel the pain.
  Enter Phase Two.
  I won't spoil the reveal.
  Hurry outside for a little taste of what's to come.
  Ciao, mon ami.
  He's outside.
 Let's go.
  GCPD.
  GCPD! Make way.
  - GCPD.
 Excuse me.
 - Back up.
    - Are they dead? - Get forensics here.
  And I want this whole area closed off.
 No press.
  That pig's eating that guy.
      Now, Harper.
  Excuse me.
  Where's breakfast?  Breakfast was  produced and consumed by yours truly at breakfast time.
  It is now fast approaching luncheon, Master Bruce.
  Whatever, just give me a coffee.
  Enjoying the benefits  of another night out on the tiles with Tommy Elliot  and his band of miscreants, are we?  How absolutely delightful.
  I know what you're going through, you know, Master Bruce.
  Yeah.
  I went out with my friends.
 I'm hungover.
  Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.
  You're lost is what you are.
  I've seen that countless times young men,  going off to war with a clear purpose,  only to return home to a normal life, unable to assimilate.
  Confused, angry.
  And they make a complete tosh of it.
  I don't really care.
  You killed Ra's al Ghul.
  Vengeance for your parents' death  has been your driving force for so long.
  You are completely lost without it.
  I need to call Tommy.
  Have you forgotten what day it is today?  - Give me my phone.
 - You have, ain't you?  Today is the day my father took me camping  and we put a rock on top of Mount Bristol.
  We did it every year.
 Now give me my phone.
  You are Bruce Wayne, son of Thomas Wayne.
  And the sooner you start remembering that, the better.
  So, you drink your coffee.
  You go upstairs, you put your kit on, 'cause you and I  are going for a walk.
      According to the medical examiner,  both victims had been living outdoors for some time.
  Most likely homeless.
  Now, see these incisions?  He removed their organs.
  - Any idea why? - Not yet.
  Pyg all but announced that his next victims  would be the rich and powerful, the high in Gotham.
  So why is he killing the homeless?  You're asking for logic from a psychopath.
  From him, yeah.
  Everything he's done has been thought through carefully.
  There was a card on the table in French,  said, Long Live the Revolution.
  Maybe he's using them to make a statement.
  - He wants the city's attention.
 - For what?  He said this was just a taste of what's to come.
  There's a piece that's still missing.
  The homeless are densest in the Narrows.
  I'm gonna start there.
  Hell of a first day to be captain.
  Yeah.
  Call me, you find anything else.
 We checked all buildings  in a three-block radius, Captain.
 Nothing.
  All right, widen it out a couple of blocks.
  Focus on buildings with protected loading docks.
  Captain, that was Lucius Fox.
  Final tox came back.
  Both victims had sodium sulfide  and chlorine residue on their skin.
  He says it's common in paper manufacturing.
  There's an old paper plant few blocks from here  that closed down a while back.
 Let's check that out.
    Backup's still incoming.
 Should we wait?  No.
 Over here.
 What is he doing to them?  Taking their organs.
 A smoker oven?  He's cooking them.
      Harper?  Drop the gun,  Captain.
  - Shoot this bastard.
 - Drop it!  Thank you.
  You found me too soon, James.
  The table's not yet set,  and no meal should be served before its time.
  You want a hostage, take me.
  No, no, no, no, no.
 That won't do at all.
  You must see my final act.
  Along with all of Gotham.
      Right, well, it's a lovely day for it.
  Best foot forward.
  Very distinguished.
  Sofia tells me you're taking part  - in a performance this evening.
 -   Oh.
 She's quite a lady, isn't she?  She's been a friend to both of us.
  Or has she?  Martin,  I worry Sofia is only pretending to be my friend.
  And worse,  I fear she may be using you.
  Now I've been running this over in my mind,  and there are two ways this might have gone.
  One, Sofia chose a specific orphan you  to place in my path.
  She groomed you.
  She told you how to act.
  Or  Sofia simply collected a group of children,  hoping one would gain my trust  and make me easier to manipulate.
  In this version, you are innocent.
  Martin  this is the version I very badly want to believe.
  But I need proof.
  Of our friendship.
  I need to know if my suspicions are correct.
  And if so, what Sofia is planning  and who she is planning it with.
  I need you to be my eyes and my ears.
  Do you think you can do that?  Don't let me down, Martin.
  Please.
 I want a city-wide BOLO on that van.
  I want every cop in Gotham on the streets, looking for Harper.
  She will not be the Pyg's next victim.
  Go.
    - Captain Gordon! - Captain Gordon!    Is it true that the serial killer known as the Pyg is back?  That he's responsible for the scene  outside the GCPD this morning?  We believe so, yes.
  We've also heard he's kidnapped a GCPD detective.
  How can you keep the people of Gotham safe  when you can't protect your own officers?  We remain hopeful for Detective Harper's safe return.
  Let me be clear.
  The GCPD will stop this monster; that's a promise.
  And if you fail, will you be  pushed aside like Harvey Bullock was?  - We're done here.
 Thank you.
 -   What about the rumor that the Pyg is now cooking his victims?  Who told you that?  Is it true?  As I said, the GCPD will bring the Pyg to justice.
  That's all.
    Captain Gordon!  Someone leaked to the press that the Pyg is cooking his victims.
  Maybe it was the Pyg.
  We know he wants attention.
  Look, Jim, everyone in the department is on your side.
  Yeah.
    There's something you need to see.
 I grant this food will be somewhat dear,  and therefore very proper for landlords, who,  as they have already devoured most of the parents,  seem to have the best title to the children.
  It's Jonathan Swift, A Modest Proposal.
  He made an argument  for cannibalism, about the rich eating the poor.
  The poor are the homeless.
  Who are the rich?  Swift didn't just talk about the rich eating the poor.
  He specifically mentioned the orphans.
  I know where he's going.
  He left this for me.
  He's doing exactly what he did with Harvey.
 It could be a trap.
  And I won't lead more officers to their deaths.
  - You're going alone? - I'm sorry, Lucius.
  - Where's Chef Louis? -   Ici, mademoiselle.
  Such a pleasure to meet you in person.
  Hmm.
 I was expecting you earlier.
   Apologies.
 I was detained.
  But I've made a small change in the menu.
  I have steered us away from haute cuisine  to something a bit more mundane.
  Et voilÃ .
    I am calling them Gotham Meat Pies.
  Your guests will die for them.
  I've made us a delicious brown English stew  with herb dumplings, Master Bruce.
  Your father used to love it when I made stew.
  Did I ever tell you how I met your old man?  In London.
 He was doing postgrad work there.
  He told me.
  Yeah, but no details.
  Well, I was just out the army, two months.
  Don't remember any of it.
  All a bit of a blur, really booze, drugs, brawling.
  A sucking great black cloud.
  One day, I wake up and I'm lying in this alley,  and I'm covered in blood don't know how.
  So I picked myself up,  I took myself straight down to the police station,  turned myself in, hoping that they would  chuck me into the big house and throw away the key.
  And they told me to shut up, sit down and wait.
 And there was this  really annoying Yank wandering about,  dressed like he was ready for a game of tennis,  and it was your dad.
  Anyway, he bowls up to me, asks me what I done.
  Asking me questions.
  Eventually, you know, I found myself  telling him stuff that I was too frightened even to think about.
  But I guess it'd just been building.
  Anyway, that point, the desk sergeant called him over,  and your dad turned around to me and he said,  Alfred, last night, I was being attacked in that alley,  and you started fighting this geezer.
  I headed on my toes, and I ran away.
  And I said, Yeah, but that's not what happened,  is it, Thomas?  And he says, It is now.
  Your father saved my life.
  His friendship saved me.
  You see, I know what it's all like, being lonely.
  Hoping that the world will punish you.
  I can help you.
  - Bruce - Alfred, I hear you.
  I just don't want to talk about this right now.
  All right.
  Well, this looks lovely.
  The rocks are gone.
 They must've fell out in the car.
  Oh, the keys are in the bag, just there.
        - Beautiful.
 So nice to see you, dear.
 - Thanks.
  Yes.
      Oswald, you came!  Look at you two.
  So handsome.
  I know how important tonight's party is to you.
  And I wouldn't have forgiven myself  if I missed Martin's performance.
  Why don't you go find the other children.
 Did you locate the mayor?  Unfortunately, no.
  Hmm.
  But I have not given up hope.
  Well, I, for one, am happy.
  This way, you get to come to my dinner.
  I need to go check on the chef.
 He seems a bit odd.
   Please try and enjoy yourself.
 Let's go.
 Straight ahead, down to the left.
    Hello, Martin.
  What are you writing?  Don't make a noise.
  Shh.
  I'm a cop.
  Who are you?  A-A waiter.
  I'm looking for a man, Caucasian, about five-foot-ten.
  He would've brought the food.
 Maybe the chef.
  Uh, the chef's in the kitchen.
  Look, I just got hired tonight.
  Whatever the dude's into, I have no idea.
 I'm just here  You're okay, you're okay.
  Do me a favor, find Ms.
 Falcone, bring her to me.
  - Can you do that for me? - Yeah.
 All right.
  What's that in your jacket?    Jim Gordon really is an impressive policeman.
  Is he alone?  Seems so.
  But, man, whatever it is you're into,  my partner and I?  Our rates just doubled.
      Harper.
  My friends, the Falcone orphanage  is the realization of a long cherished dream,  and one that would not have been possible without your support.
  - So thank you.
 Cheers.
 Cheers.
  Now, if you could please take your seats in the next room,  a few of the children have prepared a song.
    Where's Martin?  I wanted to wish him luck.
  Ah.
 Off getting ready, no doubt.
  Oswald, I've been thinking.
  Maybe things happen for a reason.
  Licensing crime was a bold move,  but it would've destroyed you.
  Whoever had Jim Gordon appointed captain  may actually have saved you.
  By attempting to destroy everything I ever created?  - Oswald - Enough.
  If you're going to confess, confess.
  And face the consequences.
    So sorry to interrupt.
  The servers are getting everyone seated.
  We don't want the food to get cold.
  Shall we go in to dinner?  Chop, chop.
    All right.
 I stopped the bleeding, I think.
  That's the best I can do until I can get you out of here.
  Got to get that door open.
  - Gordon.
 - Maybe I can get the hinges off.
  Gordon.
  Idiots forgot to search me.
        Was this another one of your plans?  No.
    Ladies and gentlemen, as you by now have surmised,  there's been a change in the program.
  Tonight, we are proud to present  the six merry Gothamites of Squatter's Row,  and Martin,  from the Falcone Home and School for Orphans,  in our rendition of  the Meat Pie Tango.
  Bob   Fricks   Trish   Nunuh   Cyrano   Vincent     You have it coming, you have it coming   You only have yourself to blame   If you'd have been fair, if you'd have been keen   I betcha these pies wouldn't taste the same!   Enough! Where are the other children?  If you hurt them, I swear      Rude.
  I'm not finished.
  Sit down.
  Pull it out, and the next one's in her eye.
  Oswald, no.
    Now, to answer your question, my dear,  the other children and your staff  are safely locked in the kitchen.
  Despite appearances, I'm not an animal.
    Martin.
  May we continue?  You have all fed upon the poor of Gotham for years.
  Now you're going to know what they taste like.
  Please, open your envelopes and look at the photographs inside.
    Oh, come on.
  - Open them! -     Who is Trish?  Well, I thought you should see who you're eating.
    Bob, Fricks,  Trish, Nunuh, Cyrano and Vincent  all deserve our gratitude.
  So these pies are  People.
 Yep.
  They're people pies.
  People.
  And you're all going to eat them.
 Oh, no.
  Absolutely not.
  Okay.
  Let's try this again.
  - No! -   Eat, or I kill the boy.
 But he's just an orphan.
  What did you say?  Well, these are made of people.
 I mean, so they kill some urchin, hmm?        What a waste of a good pie.
  But I do applaud the sentiment.
  Especially as you, Mr.
 Cobblepot, are the reason I'm here.
  Me? Why?  Oh, I could've chosen any gathering of wealthy Gothamites  who've gotten fat upon the poor.
  But you, with your Pax Penguina,  you are the biggest glutton of them all.
  You have gorged yourself on this city's heart,  its lungs, its liver.
  Why should today be any different?  Now eat, little Penguin.
  Eat.
  Eat the pies, or the boy dies.
        If you don't eat,  I will hunt you down and kill you all!    Now, that's what I like to see.
    And as Mother always used to say,  Nobody leaves until every plate is clean.
  It's a compliment to the chef, and I love compliments.
  And, Ms.
 Falcone  mangia, signorina.
  Only if you don't hurt him.
  Can you help me?  Yes.
 Jim!  Get out of here!  Go!      Come on, Jim.
  Don't give up.
 You'll ruin everything.
  Should be good.
    How is your hand?  I'll be fine.
  How's Martin?  He is stronger than he looks.
  You paid off the mayor to make Jim Gordon captain.
 Yes.
  And you want me to believe  that you did this out of friendship.
  To save me.
  I tried to talk you out of the license program.
  You wouldn't listen.
  There seemed no other way.
  Of course, it's equally plausible  that you are my enemy,  intent upon my destruction.
  You could choose to see it that way.
  Choice is yours, Oswald.
  Well, whatever your actual reasoning  you went behind my back.
  I would be justified in killing you.
    But what you were going to do for Martin  that was real.
  Don't ever betray me again.
  Never.
  I will abandon the licenses,  but Jim Gordon cannot be captain.
  Pick someone else, then.
  Gordon's less than nothing to me.
 Bye-bye, Piggy, bye-bye   - Captain Gordon! -   Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!  - Captain Gordon? -   Is that the Pyg? Did you really catch him?  The suspect known as the Pyg is in custody.
  Detective Vanessa Harper is on her way to Gotham General,  and is expected to make a full recovery.
  The GCPD kept its promise.
  Captain Gordon?  Yes?  Thank you.
  Thank you.
            Oh.
    Hey, hey, Alfred!  How was your walk?  Everybody out now.
  Nobody move.
  This is not your house.
  If I want my friends to stay, they're staying.
  Like hell they are.
  Dude, your butler is a little out of line.
 Have you been hitting  the sherry, Jeeves?  You have no idea what extreme danger  you are now in, son.
  If I was you, I would walk away.
  Yeah, whatever.
  Meet us at the club.
  Come on.
 Driver will take us.
    - Well -   you've certainly shown a new side of yourself today,  - haven't you, Master Bruce? - Save it, Alfred.
  You tell me a story about you and my dad,  and I'm supposed to get all weepy?  You don't know what I'm going through.
  You and I are nothing alike.
  Then talk to me.
  Let me know h-how I can help you.
  You can't.
  Like you said, I did what I did.
  I killed Ra's.
  I avenged my parents' death, and guess what.
  Nothing changed.
  It made no difference.
  So then what did I do it for?  How can you help that?  I can help with the way that you're feeling.
  But you need to talk to me.
  You have to face up to who you really are.
  Stop telling me who I am.
  I know who I am.
  And if you really want to help me,  you can stop trying to be my father,  and you can be my butler.
  Clean this place up.
 Tommy!        You're the hero of the day.
  I was just doing my job.
  I know you hate me  for what I did, but you deserve to be captain.
  I went to your father for help.
  I knew what I was getting into.
  Doesn't mean I have to like it.
  But you accept it.
  Because I do deserve it.
  Just like Gotham deserves law and order.
  And I'm gonna make sure it gets it.
  You don't think I want that, too?  I'm not your enemy, Jim.
  I never will be.
    Did you find anything out?  I saw Sofia  kissing the policeman.
  Is this true?    Martin, you are a good friend.
  As for Sofia  she will answer for what she's done.
  I swear it.
